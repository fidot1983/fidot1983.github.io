<hr class="dashed"/><p>After I posted my <a class="reference external" href="http://79ft.net/entries/misccheetah-messing-with-cheetah-august-2014/">story on removing the footstep</a>
to <a class="reference external" href="https://mailman.xmission.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/grumman-gang">Grumman Gang mailing list</a>,
Ken Blackman of <a class="reference external" href="http://airmodsnw.com">AirMods NW</a> fame wrote me an
email.. He recognized the plane, and apparently he flew it back in the 70s
and had a great story to share... Here it is, below.</p>
<p><strong>Ken Blackman's Story</strong></p>
<p>...we were so desperate for airplanes we were picking up &quot;drop-outs&quot; from
other dealers canceling orders when they came available and this plane was
one (sans the little tanks) we bought while at the 1977 Dealer Convention.
We has also agreed to purchase a '75 Traveler &quot;Repo&quot; from Grumman Credit that
a dealer had faulted on.  It was in Oklahoma City.  Maynard took airlines to
OKC to get the Traveler and I was going to fly the Cheetah to San Jose, drop
it there, and fly the AA-5 on up to our facility at Everett, WA for needed
mechanical work and sale prep.  (We had a much better maintenance facility
at my end of the operation) I was within a half hour of leaving when the
delivery center paged me to the phone.  It was Maynard and he was asking me
to come to OKC and pick him up at the Traveler was a total piece of crap.</p>
<p>I flew there and we stayed overnight to get a got early take-off the next day.
This was in January and there had just been a minor snow fall all through our
intended route through Albuquerque and on west to California.  The weather was
clear the next day and winds were forecast to be light &amp; variable.  There was
a big high pressure coming into the NM area so we figured we would make ABQ
the first leg, refuel, and on to Prescott.  The 37 gal. usable put us on a
thin edge for the first leg but we figured we had close to VFR reserves.
Tracking the VORs, measuring the distances and doing the math I was maintaining
a steady 145 to 147 MPH and flying at the higher altitudes we were getting real
good economy.  From Tucumcari to the next VORTAC I calculated 146 MPH and the
previous leg was 147.  Marking the time from that one to the next one would
require a certain number of minutes enroute so we continued along in smooth air.
Maynard was sound asleep in the right seat.  When the stopwatch showed we should
be arriving at the next fix the &quot;TO/FROM&quot; didn't flip.  I waited another couple
of minutes, then started looking at my chart and the ground for references.
(Lots of luck over the desert.)  I woke Maynard up wrestling the chart and he
asked what was going on.  I explained we should have been at the check point
10 minutes ago but weren't.  We both started looking for ground references and
finally found two roads that intersected along our route line and identified we
were still a good 25 miles from the VOR.</p>
<p>I called Flight Service and was connected to a briefer in ABQ.  I explained our
situation and he said there as a weather phenomenon occurring called a
&quot;Venturi Effect&quot; I had never heard of.  The high pressure area coming into the
ABQ area was causing wind to flow into the lower pressure area we were in and,
coming through the Sandia Gap east of ABQ, set up a headwind that dissipated
just east of our position.  We had a head wind of nearly 50 MPH!  This
definitely put Albuquerque out of range but retreating to Tucumcari would not
work because we would lose the wind very soon and not have the push needed to
get there.  Santa Fe was possible as we would be flying about 80 degrees to
the wind direction and it would dissipate before we were half way there but it
was a stretch and they were having snow pellets and possible freezing rain in
the forecast.  Looking at the chart I found a dirt strip at Kline's Corners
right along a freeway and cross road intersection.  It was within our range so
we headed for it.  Arriving at the intersection and identifying it we could
only find a ragged old windsock on top of a collapsing building in the middle
of a lot of snow.  &quot;NFY&quot;</p>
<p>We flew low over the cross road but there were power and phone lines that would
prevent landing on it.  There was the freeway and an underpass where that cross
road went over it.  There was a Chevron gas station there with the on-ramp to
the interstate and traffic was light.  We made a low pass to check for obstacles
and it was good for about a half mile past the on-ramp.  We made a left hand
downwind and tried to set up a landing but there were a couple of cars we were
concerned about followed by a couple more that we didn't trust to not panic and
run into us if we landed in front of them.  We went around again and had a
similar problem plus two cars were coming down the on-ramp.  We were flying on
the tank that read the most fuel and, about the time we turned downwind, the
engine quit!  Switched tanks and decided we were committed this time.  There
was a Semi just going under the overpass and another one a mile or so behind
it.  Trusting that the driver of the 2nd one would not run is over, we settled
down to land about where the on ramp joined the freeway.</p>
<p>We taxied off the main lanes to the shoulder and turned 45 degrees to the left
and shut down.  The Trucker pulled his rig up to block anyone from hitting our
plane and got out his flairs.  &quot;What'd ya do, run out of gas?&quot; he asked.
&quot;Nope, but close.  If you think you are going to run dry, for God's sake,
land before you do!&quot;  I replied.  About that time a state trooper came flying
off the opposite set of freeway lanes, bounding across the dirt, snow covered
median and blocked the right lane of the highway.  He had picked up the CB call
from the trucker.  After explain our situation to him he asked if he should
call a tow truck... &quot;NO!!!&quot;  I asked if he could just block traffic back of
the in-ramp and we would taxi it up to the gas station.  He did and we did.
(I had to zig-zag through the edge of road snow markers but made it fine.)</p>
<p>This was before EAA was working with MO-GAS and we didn't know how it would
react to it.  We decided to use the higher octane unleaded so stuffed a hose
in each tank and filled it up.  The cop blocked off the freeway again and one
of the guys from the station drove his pickup to park under the power lines
and turned on his flashers.  We taxied back to the underpass to give us a
little more runway I did a run-up only to have the engine run very rough.
We thought the car gas might be causing this then realized we were about
7,000 ft, MSL, and full rich was not the correct procedure.  Leaned it out half
way and run-up was fine.  Take off was long but we were well above the power
lines and on our way to ABQ.  The damned thing ran better, and burned a
little less per hour with the car gas.  We decided to park it in ABQ and get
a good dinner and night's sleep before flying on the next day to San Jose.</p>
<p>We decided to leave the plane at RHV and I flew a used trade in 2 place on home.
The owners of Bede Micro (Keith Henshaw and Rod (his partner)) were close
friends of Maynard and had become so with me.  They developed the Honda Turbo
conversion for the BD-5 and stretched the fuselage.  They had a facility to
help people build their BD-5 kits with their tooling and fixtures and
assistance.  They were talking about getting a Grumman for their running around
and bought '91U soon after it arrived.</p>
<p>There was a good article about Keith in Sport Aviation, I think the January
or Feb. issue this year, about his achievements in supporting the BD aircraft
and development of the Honda powered version.  (He passed away last winter
in his late '80s.)</p>
<p>Well, now you know the bit of history of your airplane that is not in the log
books.</p>

<hr class="dashed"/><p>Weekends are plane days now. I fly to my friend's hangar and mess with 91U,
the Cheetah (I still need a name for her :) ).</p>
<p>This past few weeks Ive been doing little stuff here and there...</p>
<p>Cleaned up the nav lights lenses.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">After</p><p>... they still look like crap, so I'll probably bite the bullet and buy a set
of new ones.</p>
<p>Oh, and I need to make those vertical &quot;shields&quot; that cover the strobes  away
from the pilot's view.. Ill probably get the new lenses after I make those
shields.</p>
<p>Started getting under the panel and cleaning things up, preparing for the
<a class="reference external" href="http://buy-ei.com/portfolio/cgr-30p-overview/">CGR-30 Engine Monitor</a>
installation (I got one for a really good price at Oshkosh).</p>
<p>Taking the glareshield off, found this:</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">All dead defroster SCAT tubing</p><p>I'll need to replace all that...</p>
<p>Started taking the old gages off and thinking about where Im gonna put what.</p>
<p>I'll need to make some plugs for the holes emptied.</p>
<p>Right now, I have analog and half-broken EGT (the selector switch is dead),
analog CHT that's not hooked up to anything (wires are butted, and there are
no probes installed). Those are going away.
HOBBS is also going away. This is all being replaced with CGR-30, so I
get a few empty holes and options to move gauges around. I'll probably move
the clock and the vac suction gauge so that they're better visible.</p>
<p>Pictures will come later when the work is actually done :)</p>
<p>This last weekend started quite jolly with me putting in the engine
grounding straps (didn't have them when I bought the plane).</p>

   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/misccheetah-messing-with-cheetah-august-2014/img_0449-thumb.jpg" title="Grounding Strap 2" alt="Grounding Strap 2" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Grounding Strap 2</p><p>And then, I decided to deal with something special; the Foot Step. You
see, I don't like them. I think they're ugly. So, I decided to remove them,
and make a couple of fairings to cover the holes up and to replace the original
plastic fairings.</p>
<p>Beej helped me (that means, &quot;did it himself&quot; rather ;) ) whip out the first
test fairing.</p>
<p>And then, we needed to take off the steps.</p>
<p>The steps are bolted thru the fuse honeycomb with a couple of backing plates.
There are two bolts, top is aluminum one (the thought is that it will shear
before the bottom one and therefore prevent leverage and damage to sensitive
fuse sidewall honeycomb). I believe AG-5s (later Grummans) replaced them with
steel bolts; and people had some serious honeycomb crushing issues because of
that.</p>
<p>Aaanyway. The bolts come from the inboard side, thru the streamlined tubing of
the footstep and a couple bushings, and fasten themselves to the nutplates
riveted to the other side of the footstep. Here's the schematic from the
Parts Manual.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/misccheetah-messing-with-cheetah-august-2014/footstep.jpg" title="Footstep Schematic" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/misccheetah-messing-with-cheetah-august-2014/footstep-thumb.jpg" title="Footstep Schematic" alt="Footstep Schematic" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Footstep Schematic</p><p>There are a couple more bushings inside the streamlined tubing that aren't
shown...</p>
<p>Also, the footstep sits in the wing root. You can kinda get access to the
bottom nutplate if you take the fairing off.
The top is right in the center of the wing root. And wing
roots on Grummans are <em>not</em> fairings. I don't know how to remove one without
pulling the whole wing (and Im not quite ready to do that yet...).</p>
<p>So anyway, happy me, I undo the rear seats and the cover that covers all
the business under them, take the wrench, &quot;assume the position&quot; and start
undoing the bolts. The first thing that happens is the rivets holding
nutplates snap off.</p>
<p>So now, I am having Beej, not a small guy at all, under the plane on a
creeper, holding the nutplates. We did the bottom one fast, the top one
is a pain in the ass because it's, like I said, in the wing root. Had to take
the flaps torque tube inspection plate off to get to it, and even then only
could hold it with fingers.. the torque tube is getting in the way, you can't
get any tools in there.</p>
<p>I should also mention that the bolts sit right under the back seat framing
that holds the seat, and I can't even <em>see</em> the bolts I'm undoing without an
inspection mirror. Gladly, not much there, so I've found them easily.</p>
<p>So, we undid the bolts.</p>
<p>Hehe. Now, to getting them out...</p>
<p>We were able to tap the bottom bolt out fairly easily. Well, it's right there
under the footstep fairing, so that wasn't a problem.</p>
<p>The top bolt is the whole other story...</p>
<p>You see, the bushing inside the streamlined tube is steel. And the bolt is
aluminum. The Mother Nature decided to give me a practical lesson on
dissimilar metal corrosion.</p>
<p>So Saturday, as this was progressing and it was getting late (and time for
Beej to go home), we tried pulling it, rotating it with a ratchet while
pushing on the side. No joy.</p>
<p>Beej had to go. We had to disband.</p>
<p>I parked the plane in transient on Beej's field (I couldn't fly back with the
footstep dangling like that on one bolt:)); and went home, determined to
fix it. Had to have Dash pick me up...</p>
<p>Talked with Ben for over an hour.. Got a lot of good advice. &quot;Heat it up&quot;.
&quot;Liquid Wrench&quot;. &quot;Die Grinder&quot;.</p>
<p>Furnished a whole bunch of various tools. Some of them will probably scare
some aircraft mechanics :)</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/misccheetah-messing-with-cheetah-august-2014/img_0455.jpg" title="The Tools To Pull That Bolt" >

 </a> <p class="small text-center">The Tools To Pull That Bolt</p><p>Note the pry-bar notch enlarged to take an AN5 bolt. I also custom-beveled the
cold chisel to give it a sharper angle (hoping I'll be able to get it under the
bolt head).</p>
<p>Sunday.</p>
<p>Put a bunch of Liquid Wrench on that bolt.
Tried the chisel - nothing.</p>
<p>Did I mention that I couldn't see the bolt, only feel it? :)</p>
<p>Tried pulling, rotating with Vise Grips - nothing.</p>
<p>Soaked in more Liquid Wrench. Nothing.</p>
<p>Looking at it from the inspection mirror, it was clear that I could cut the
head off if I could see it (I would never try that blind. Ever).</p>
<p>So, the mission became the &quot;See The Bolt Head&quot; one.</p>
<p>Bottom interior side panel, if came off, would reveal the bolt from the top and
give me access.</p>
<p>Top interior side panel was blocking the bottom interior side panel.</p>
<p>Also, seatbelts and a little latch for the rear seat.</p>
<p>So, off went all of that.</p>
<p>Finally, I saw the sucker!</p>
<p>Tried pulling it out a bit more, now when I had a better access point.. no
luck.</p>
<p>Oh well. To The Dremel!</p>
<p>The rest is...</p>
<p>History :)</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">The nasty, nasty bolt shank with the bushing "welded" onto it by corrosion</p><p>But the Mother Nature wasn't done with me yet.</p>
<p>Buttoned the plane back up; pulled it in front of the hangar, and took Beej to
lunch.</p>
<p>Came back.</p>
<p>Realized that I left the keys to my car in my wife's car parked at a terminal.</p>
<p>Had to walk there and back. A good mile.</p>
<p>Oh, did I mention the 100 degree Texas summer? :)</p>
<p>Coming back, needed to push the plane back. But no - the parking brake on one
of the wheels was completely and utterly stuck.</p>
<p>My Cheetah is a 77, and uses mechanical parking brake. Ive heard before that
they get stuck; but I always was able to get them unstuck by taking the
brake off and tapping on the pedals with my feet.</p>
<p>The way they work is there is a metal plate that has a hole thru which the
brake cylinder's piston's shaft goes thru. There's a chain that pulls it
up, making it eccentric with the shaft, which locks the shaft in place.</p>
<p>Well; apparently it got a little more hot while we ate, and that plate just
didn't want to go down. Tapping the pedals while putting the brakes on and
off didn't do anything.</p>
<p>Oh, did I mention that I would have fiddle with it, get out, try to push the
plane back, fail, get back in, all in a 100 degree weather? Not fun.</p>
<p>Finally, gave up and &quot;assumed the position&quot; again. That's when you dive
backwards under the panel with feet hanging out of the airplane.</p>
<p>Wiggling it for a minute or so finally yielded a loud snap, and it was unstuck.</p>
<p>Phew.</p>
<p>Flight back home was uneventful :).</p>

<hr class="dashed"/><p>Heh. Multi-week moments of silence seem to start taking hold here. I haven't
got much time to work on anything lately.</p>
<p>You see, I have finally decided that I am going to get myself something to fly
while I work on the Bolt. I haven't flown for some months, and the withdrawal
was settling in pretty badly.</p>
<p>Problem is, I moved to Texas about 8 months ago. Back where I lived before I
used to own a 1/3 of a Grumman &quot;N28797&quot; Tiger; flying her at least once a week.
I often would spend weekends bouncing between airports and hangar-flying in
between hops, and took her to Oshkosh last year.</p>
<p>After moving, the only airplanes I was able to access were ratty Cherokees and
Cessnas in a local flight school; and I could no longer go on my day-long hops
just because it was too expensive. Writing $400 checks every time I went flying
just... hurt, and I ended up not flying much.</p>
<p>So, a decision was made. I was to buy a plane.</p>
<p>A few strategically placed calls to my friends back in California immediately
yielded a very good deal on a Grumman Cheetah (it had to be a Grumman of course)
:).</p>
<p>Now, Cheetah is the same airframe as Tiger less 200 pounds of max gross and an
O-320 instead of an O-360. Figuring that I now live on the right side of the
Rockies and don't need to cross them much, my thinking is that Cheetah will
actually suite my mission much better.</p>
<p>So, I hopped on a Winged Tubular Human Transporter, and was in CA
a few hours later.</p>

the airplane you truly know and love to fly, again.</p>

lots of paperwork.</p>
<p>Funny thing: apparently one of the radios was stolen from this plane in 1995..</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Buckeye: approaching Phoenix. Lunch time!</p><p>After lunch in Phoenix, we took off... My second in command Dash noticed high
oil temps -- and I reduced the climb, leveling off finally at 5500. The oil
just did not want to cool! Half way between Phoenix and Tuscon, the oil
finally got a bit cooler, and I attempted climbing some more, but no
joy. The moment I start climbing, the oil would hit redline. After trying
that a couple times, we decided to bail in Tuscon, and spend a night there.
Plan was to take off at 5:30 in the morning, and get past high terrain that
starts after Tuscon early in the morning.</p>
<p>Cooling off in the FBO at Ryan Field near Tuscon, we started looking for
options. It was Saturday, so renting a car didn't work out. I found a business
card for <a class="reference external" href="http://tucson-taxi.com/">Jeannie's Taxi</a> in the FBO and called
her up.</p>
<p>Jeannie's great! She came out immediately, and took us back over a great little
road winding thru the Black Mountain and Old Tuscon; and agreed to pick us up
at 4:30 in the morning!! We also had a great conversation pretty much about
everything as we drove.</p>
<p>Next came Demming, New Mexico. A sad sight of an Arrow stuck on a runway at a
weird angle warned that something was amiss. Luckily, Demming had two runways
so I landed on another one. Noticed guys at the FBO already rolling in a golf
cart to a now obviously belly-landed retractable Arrow, and decided to just
wait.</p>
<p>The FBO guys rolled in a few minutes later. &quot;What happened? Did he forget?&quot; -
&quot;He forgot&quot;. Oh well. Gas-Undercarriage-Mixture-Prop...</p>
<p>One of the guys started fueling us. They have already lifted the Arrow,
extended the landing gear, and rolled her into a spare hangar by the time we
were leaving.</p>
<p>Fort Stockton was our last en-route stop; and three hours after that we were
approaching San Marcos, my temporary home.</p>
<p>17 hours.</p>
<p>What a trip.</p>
<p>I am no longer planeless.</p>
<p>Amen.</p>
