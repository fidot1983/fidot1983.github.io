<hr class="dashed"/><p>This thing nagged me for a while. The Charger did not have the Field breaker.
For that matter, it didn't have the Alternator master breaker, either.</p>
<p>It had this weird &quot;main buss&quot; breaker for 60 amps, but that didn't look
like the Alternator breaker to me.</p>
<p>So in between dealing with other things after having decided to
put her thru <a class="reference external" href="/category/chickenhouse-charger2019-annual.html">Annual in 2019</a>
a bit early, I was running around with my multimeter, tracing wires.</p>
<p>Initially, I quickly discovered that some lines were definitely not fused;
like Battery -&gt; Main Buss line, and thought I'd put inline fuses
into them, and be done.</p>
<p>She has an old charging system; a <em>mechanical</em> switching voltage regulator, and
a Delco Remy alternator seemingly from a tractor:</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-05-16-fire-hazard/fh-1.jpg" title="The old Delco-Remy" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-05-16-fire-hazard/fh-1-thumb.jpg" title="The old Delco-Remy" alt="The old Delco-Remy" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">The old Delco-Remy</p><p>Voltage regulator didn't make sense. It had 4 wires (should be 2: supply and
field output, or 3: supply, sense, and field output).</p>
<p>Alternator didn't make sense. Instead of 1 wire for Field input, it had
two wires.</p>
<p>Additionally, Battery Contactor didn't make sense. One terminal had a wire
going to it. The other was grounded....</p>
<div class="section" id="interlude">
<h2>Interlude</h2>
<p>Battery Contactor is an interesting point here. Normally, one terminal
is connected to the &quot;always hot&quot; side of it (basically, directly to the battery)
and the other goes to the Master Switch. Master Switch turns the Battery
Contactor on by grounding that wire, providing the negative side to the circuit.
It's a safety thing. If that wire breaks, it'll either turn the electrical off
(open circuit), or it will keep it turned on (short to ground). That's it.</p>
<p>But, one of the terminals on the Battery Contactor was grounded... that means,
that the other terminal (the wire coming from the Master Switch) must provide
positive side??? Huh? But where does it get it's power <em>from</em>?</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="tracing">
<h2>Tracing</h2>
<p>So to tracing we went. I spend maybe 10 hours trying to find diagrams
and understand that alternator and voltage regulator hookups.</p>
<p>And me tracing it spelled my doom.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-diagram">
<h2>The Diagram</h2>
<p>Now, I didn't trace the rest of it. Just the main distribution system. That was
enough.</p>
<p>Shall we?</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-05-16-fire-hazard/fh-2.jpg" title="The current  main power system of the Charger" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-05-16-fire-hazard/fh-2-thumb.jpg" title="The current  main power system of the Charger" alt="The current  main power system of the Charger" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">The current  main power system of the Charger</p><p>Yep, the diagram is missing the main power buss. It's dangling off of the
same spot where everything else that's interesting is - the
Battery Contactor (marked MA RELAY) &lt;-&gt; Starter Contactor (marked STARTER REL)
link.</p>
<p>So let's see what we have here.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Lots of unfused wires. Do you see a <em>single</em> fuse here? Nope. That's because there aren't any. All the fuses are further downstream, off of the main buss.</li>
<li>Voltage Regulator has this extra wire running to / from cockpit that isn't really necessary and could've been kept on the hot side of the firewall (terminal 4 wire)</li>
<li>Alternator field broken at <em>output</em> (F-&gt;ALT) rather than at <em>input</em> (battery -&gt; terminal 3)</li>
<li>And the best part? <strong>Always hot wire that you can't turn off</strong> between the battery and the Master Switch to turn the Master Solenoid on.</li>
</ul>
<p>That last bit bugged me. I couldn't <em>find</em> the damn thing. Even before
actually tracing it, I knew that if the Master Solenoid is switched on the &quot;hot&quot;
side, it needs to get the power from somewhere, and that only could be battery. But I didn't see <em>any</em> wires on the always hot side of the Master Solenoid.
Only when I traced it, I actually traced the physical wire to where it goes, and
then found it. It was so tucked behind the battery -&gt; Master Solenoid wire that
it was invisible:</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-05-16-fire-hazard/fh-5.jpg" title="This little !@#!S@#...." >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-05-16-fire-hazard/fh-5-thumb.jpg" title="This little !@#!S@#...." alt="This little !@#!S@#...." >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">This little !@#!S@#....</p><p>Oh; and by the way, the Master Switch is the only switch that's <em>soldered</em> in,
and w/o any good insulation around the terminals, and over-stripped wires.
So that's just waiting to short, and the magic smoke that'll be let out
behind the panel when that shorts can't be stopped (always hot wire, remember?)</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-05-16-fire-hazard/fh-3.jpg" title="Master Switch" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-05-16-fire-hazard/fh-3-thumb.jpg" title="Master Switch" alt="Master Switch" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Master Switch</p></div>
<div class="section" id="the-wires">
<h2>The Wires</h2>
<p>So I kinda went backwards here; but I thought it'd be easier to see the
diagram first.</p>
<p>Let's see.</p>
<p>Most of connections are made on this very nicely marked terminal block:</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-05-16-fire-hazard/fh-4.jpg" title="The terminal block" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-05-16-fire-hazard/fh-4-thumb.jpg" title="The terminal block" alt="The terminal block" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">The terminal block</p><p>All the switched power comes out there, and every wire is marked. This
actually helped a lot in tracing. This block is on the side of the plane,
right next to the front hole's backrest.</p>
<p>You know what threw me off the most with that damned always hot wire
(I ended up tracing it <em>physically</em>)? It's how it's hooked up.</p>
<p>Yep, it is hooked up to that terminal block. To the terminal... that is
marked.. (drumroll).... &quot;Master Switch&quot;.</p>
<p>Wait.. this actually makes sense... But where's the &quot;return&quot; from the switch?</p>
<p>Ah! It's the wire that's marked.... drumroll... &quot;Fuel Gauge&quot;!</p>
<p>So really, let's look at what's going on, shall we? Zoom in the image below, it's annotated.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-05-16-fire-hazard/fh-explained.jpg" title="Untangled" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-05-16-fire-hazard/fh-explained-thumb.jpg" title="Untangled" alt="Untangled" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Untangled</p><p>So let's see. We've got this bundle of wires, a lot of which are not fused,
and one of which is always hot.</p>
<p>The Main Buss wire is the thickest one (10 gauge maybe?) that's not fused
between this buss bar and the source (engine compartment).</p>
<p>Oh, did I mention that this buss bar is on the side of the plane near the
rear instrument panel (so that 10 gauge run, and the rest of the harness
between firewall and the panel is about 30 inches long)?</p>
<p>What else do we see there? Oh! The two little 1/16inch thick aluminum lines
carrying.. fuel pressure (and oil pressure).</p>
<p>Shall I say more?</p>
<p>Shall I say that there's a fuel tank in between the front hole (passenger) and
the firewall?</p>
<p>That the wires run along between firewall and rear cockpit along that fuel
pressure line (to fuel pressure gauge)?</p>
<p>That if one shorts to this very nearby fuel pressure line, it'll burn a hole
straight thru it, and then ignite the gas that'll start coming out?</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>Can I fix all of that?</p>
<p>Sure. But rewiring will be much much easier, because I have to touch pretty much
everything. Re-running half of individual wires in a bundle is much harder than
re-running them all.</p>
<p>So, I made a decision to rewire the plane... Sigh. Looks like I won't be
flying for a looooong time.</p>
<p>Oh, and tell you what. Tracing wires on a biplane is dangerous. I ended up twisting my knee and pulling a muscle while trying to get behind the panel so badly that I couldn't walk (or sit) for 2.5 days :(.</p>

<hr class="dashed"/><p>Baffle seals on this plane are original reinforced neoprene
rubber, and they were in pretty beat up shape. There is a lot of gaps,
they sag in places, making the seal really not that good.</p>
<p>So one of the things I decided to do is to redo them.</p>
<p>Pardon the cruddy pictures; but those ones are the only ones I have :(</p>
<div class="section" id="the-nosebowl">
<h2>The Nosebowl</h2>
<p>One of the things I noticed immediately is that baffle seals were turned the
wrong way in the nosebowl area; where the front &quot;air ramp&quot; joins the bottom of
the nosebowl.</p>
<p>Here's the nosebowl and the front ramp:</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-05-17-cowling-conundrum/cc1.jpg" title="Front ramp" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-05-17-cowling-conundrum/cc1-thumb.jpg" title="Front ramp" alt="Front ramp" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Front ramp</p><p>Notice the circled area? Here it is, from the back:</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-05-17-cowling-conundrum/cc2.jpg" title="The behinds" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-05-17-cowling-conundrum/cc2-thumb.jpg" title="The behinds" alt="The behinds" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">The behinds</p><p>That marked rubber seal is in the circled area. Notice it's turned the wrong
way; &quot;into&quot; the cowling, rather than away from it? Ram air hitting that
front &quot;ramp&quot; will &quot;bend it in&quot;, and leak into the underside of the engine
compartment - precisely where it's <em>not</em> supposed to go.</p>
<p>Naive me thought that it was just wrongly installed - the rubber needed to have been folded up and out, &quot;into&quot; the lip of the nosebowl.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-05-17-cowling-conundrum/cc3.jpg" title="Correct and current seal orientation" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-05-17-cowling-conundrum/cc3-thumb.jpg" title="Correct and current seal orientation" alt="Correct and current seal orientation" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Correct and current seal orientation</p><p>Ha! Well, Remo (the guy who built the Charger) thought different.</p>
<p>There's just not enough <em>room</em> there. Everything is super tight.
The seal just won't go there and <em>stay</em> there. There's just no room.</p>
<p>Look at the above two pictures - inside and outside - again. You'll understand
why. Use pop rivet line as your reference.</p>
<p>Here's where the problem gets worse.
Ramp is really <em>thin</em> - so with just a mild pressure, I can make that gap
between the ramp and the bowl 1/4 - 3/8 inches. Guess what happens when ram
air hits it... :)</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-05-17-cowling-conundrum/cc4.jpg" title="What ram air does..." >

 </a> <p class="small text-center">What ram air does...</p><p>Okay, so then I went digging.</p>
<p>I thought this was a <em>standard</em> bowl.
I was right!</p>
<p>It's an old Comanche single style bowl (I think).</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Changer vs. the Comanche</p><p>This is cross section. Mine's on the left, Comanche's on the right.
Red is nosebowl; blue is this ramp, and black is my baffle seal.</p>
<p>Mine is &quot;concave&quot;. Comanche is &quot;convex&quot;. So if I got my thinking right,
this makes the Comanche version more rigid facing the wind.</p>
<p>Drawing from the Comanche's parts' manual confirms this proper curve.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Comanche parts manual on baffles</p><p>The parts I'm talking about are numbers 11 and 12, bottom right corner.</p>
<p>But how the heck do they seal them? Notice that the material on the drawing
above seemingly  has some &quot;dots&quot; on it (as opposed to the rubber material on
the side baffles).</p>
<p>Well, back to our &quot;remade Comanche front baffles&quot; guy.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Forward baffles from Comanche Gear guy</p><p>Felt strip!</p>
<p>Well, I guess that makes sense. Felt wrapped <em>around</em> the front ramp.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-05-17-cowling-conundrum/cc11.jpg" title="Felt strip" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-05-17-cowling-conundrum/cc11-thumb.jpg" title="Felt strip" alt="Felt strip" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Felt strip</p><p>Felt is thick and, contacting the nosebowl, I guess, will create a good
enough seal if the ramp is rigid enough. I am guessing that Comanche's
ramps are way more rigid than mine due to that opposed curve.</p>
<p>So where are we at with all this?</p>
<p>Remo probably built this noseramp himself. It looks very custom.
It's too thin and doesn't have rigidity - ram air will flex bend it
&quot;into&quot; the cowling. It's not sealed properly practically along all of that
bottom edge between the bowl and the ramp.</p>
<p>The only hope for it is that it's aerodynamic-ish and looks like a
&quot;dozer blade&quot; - curved up. Maybe the nosebowl lip deflects the air enough
for it not to go under too much:</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-05-17-cowling-conundrum/cc12.jpg" title="Airflow diagram" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-05-17-cowling-conundrum/cc12-thumb.jpg" title="Airflow diagram" alt="Airflow diagram" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Airflow diagram</p><p>Can I replace the current rubber seal with felt?</p>
<p>Maybe. The front of the engine moves. The ramp's aluminum is very light - I
am afraid that if I were to add any reasonable quantity of felt to it to hold
the seal tight it will warp the aluminum via relative motion of that ramp
(hooked up to the engine) rubbing on the bottom of the nosebowl.
Or worse yet, make a hole in the bowl.</p>
<p>Can I replace the ramp? Well, everything's possible; but that's a massive
undertaking. That ramp / nose baffle, Comanche-style, has that compound curve,
and I don't have time or skill to do it <em>fast</em>. 2 months? Maybe, if I get lucky.
BTW this is probably <em>why</em> Remo did it this way - because his is just an
aluminum sheet, wrapped around the front of the engine, &quot;neck cone&quot; style, and
cut to fit.</p>
<p>So, what do I do?</p>
<p>After discussing this at length with my good friend Ben, we settled on testing
this out first to see how bad the air flow going &quot;under&quot; will be. I can mark
the bottom of the nosebowl with some tinted oil, and go fly. Oil streaks will
tell me if the air is flowing under a lot, or not so much.</p>
<p>I'll also replace all the other baffle seals, which will improve cooling.
There's a lot of gaps to RTV, too.</p>
<p>I don't want to replace the bottom nosebowl ones, because actually there the
rigidity of old neoprene rubber seals should help...</p>

<h2>Intakes</h2>
<p>I noticed evidence of possible intake leaks, so without &quot;burping&quot; the engine,
decided to pull the intakes and replace the gaskets. This is my karma. I did
that on the Cheetah just a year ago, and scraping remnants of one of those
gaskets and re-chasing the threads took me about 10 hours; maybe more.</p>
<p>Also: interesting note: she has intake tube clamps on <em>studs</em> and not
<em>bolts</em> like every other Lycoming I've seen. Old, narrow-deck cylinders :).</p>

<hr class="dashed"/><p>Only had a few hours today, so decided to concentrate on taking off the wing root fairings. As I mentioned before, the &quot;back-side accessible&quot;
screws were set up to have nuts on them rather than nutplates. Well, I don't know about that accessibility....</p>
<p>It ended up being 3 hours for ~30 screws.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-04-06-annual/4-6-1.jpg" title="Root fairing off" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-04-06-annual/4-6-1-thumb.jpg" title="Root fairing off" alt="Root fairing off" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Root fairing off</p><p>Most of them on the back side of the wing require you reaching with a wrench thru the rear cockpit, and my arm is just barely long enough
to do that successfully. Since nuts are nyloc, no way I can hold them with my fingers - they need a socket.</p>
<p>Some of those nuts are in a U-type channel over which the fabric is glued, and some of the holes are off-center: making it impossible to put a socket over them.</p>
<p>I could've ground a socket down; but I don't have a grinder - so especially one of the nuts took a while to get off. And oh, you have to do
all that without dropping the nut and the washer onto the floor (and having them go into the tail). So the process looked like this:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Get your hand in, try to put the socket over the nut.</li>
<li>While holding the ratchet,  try to put the screwdriver into the screw w/o missing it and poking a hole in the fabric.</li>
<li>Undo the screw, almost.</li>
<li>Remove the socket, take a strong magnet.</li>
<li>Finish undoing the screw, hoping that the magnet will catch the washer and the nut.</li>
</ul>
<p>Having magnetic sockets helped. They weren't deep enough to grab most of the fully tightened nuts because screws protruded from them. I used them as magnets sometimes, and sometimes used my magnetic &quot;fishing for lost hardware&quot; probe.</p>
<p>Now I'm writing this, I realized what I should've been doing is using a long extension and a 90 degree adapter on my socket. Damn! But this still doesn't solve
the problem with some of the nuts that were hidden almost behind things that were in the way (ie, a trim control wheel's attachment structure that's
welded into the fuselage).</p>

   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-04-06-annual/4-6-3-thumb.jpg" title="One of those pesky nuts" alt="One of those pesky nuts" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">One of those pesky nuts</p><p>I'm considering replacing those nuts with Tinnerman-type and screws with sheet metal screws thru Tinnermans. I'd put some anti-chafe tape inside the U-channel,
and then Tinnermans on top of it. Since Tinnermans are long, when undoing (or tightening) the screw, they will turn and touch the side of the U-channel, which will act as a wrench.</p>

<h2>Decision</h2>
<p>After <a class="reference external" href="http://79ft.net/entries/2019-03-27-meet-81G/">getting the Charger</a>, I have decided to fix
a few basics.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Clean plugs</li>
<li>Change oil</li>
<li>Give her a good look over</li>

<p>Cowling came off.</p>

   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-03-30-annual/3-30-1-thumb.jpg" title="Cowling off" alt="Cowling off" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Cowling off</p><p>Discovered a few booboos:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Cracked cowl inlet ramp: need to stop drill.</li>
<li>Baffle seal behind the inlet ramp is turned the wrong way (Glenn was complaining about high temps - one of the reasons, hmm?).</li>
<li>Top baffle seals are too hard and sag in few spots.</li>
<li>One of the air take-offs off the ramp has almost un-riveted itself.</li>
</ul>
<p>Since I will need some helps with skills and tools with riveting, and we'll need to pull the prop to change (and turn the right way) the
seals, decided that I will put her thru annual.</p>
<p>Studying the systems (I was mainly concentrated on fuel and other al lines and hoses to see where things go), discovered a few things, too</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>She has the Rotec TBI-40-MKI TBI installed, which requires a 40 mesh filter <em>upstream</em> of it. The only filter besides finger strainers in tanks is gascolator, which goes down to 72 micron (0.003) only. Need to get a hold of Rotec people and discuss this situation.</li>
<li>The &quot;low&quot; end of the tank (in 3-point attitude) has a very nice drain fitting + drain cock draining behind the cowl. I am seriously considering adding a quick drain there - that <em>is</em> the lowest point of the tank in 3-point. My thinking is: water collected in the tank, goes to that lowest point; but there's not enough of it to go thru the take-off (which is in the middle). Then, when I raise the tail, it slushes forward, goes into the take-off, and reaches the engine right when I am just off the runway. Not Good.</li>
<li>Some un-critical drain hoses are clear vinyl and hard as a rock. For now will replace them with clear polyurethane, and if that hardens, with rubber.</li>
<li>TBI needs positive stops on the throttle quadrant. Need to check if they're present and adjust as necessary.</li>

<p>Spent the rest of the day taking off fairings and access panels. This is the first thing I thing could've been done better here methinks. Everywhere where
it was deemed that the back side would be &quot;accessible&quot;, Remo used #6-32 nyloc AN nuts on machine screws instead of nutplates. Well, some of those nuts
are <em>not</em> accessible, and I gave up on quite a bit of them around the rear wing root fairings.</p>

<h2>Fade In</h2>
<p>I met Glenn and Judi in 2014.</p>
<p>This was my second Oshkosh, and the first time I noticed the Biplane Forum's
Beer'O'Clock thread.</p>
<p>We had two &quot;events&quot; that year: one in the Vintage at the
awesome Piper Pub (yep, the spelling is right - it was a Tri-Pacer with the
baggage door that had a beer tap. The guy who owned it claimed he had an STC;
but paperwork got soaked in beer and was drying somewhere). We sneaked in a large
cooler of Austin sour beer then, hauling it all the way from the opposite end of Camp
Scholler. I met Glenn there, and later that night washed out in his camp and was fed
with a kick-ass grilled cheese sandwich, and met Judi.</p>
<p>The second &quot;event&quot; was at Glenn's airplane, parked near Homebuilder's HQ. It was a beautiful
Marquart Charger, I learned then; a 1987 Golden Lindy recipient, built by Remo Galeazzi in Petaluma, CA.</p>
<p>That biplane was beautiful; just the right curves and not as aggressive as more modern ones like Pitts and Skybolts.
It looked straight from the 1930s, with wooden prop tipping the nose. I fell in love with it.</p>
<p>In 2015, we've had a good crowd around the plane.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Oshkosh 2015 Biplane Forum Beer'o'Clock crowd</p><p>Glenn's Charger became a traditional spot for these beer get-togethers, and we became friends who only met at Oshkosh; but to me
it felt like I knew Glenn for my whole life, and 11.5 months between AirVentures felt like hours.</p>
<p>In 2016, I was finally around Chicago where Glenn lived, and he took me out to his home field, Poplar Grove.
Man, what an airport! Just the right kind for his plane. We spent a day there, and I think I have seen only <em>one</em> spam can
and maybe one RV. The others were a few Cubs, a Twin Beech, a Waco, and the like. A few friends showed up, and that day I got
a ride in an AcroSport bipe, and later in the evening, finally, in the Charger.</p>
<p>Oh man. I flew a couple sport biplanes before; and while I liked them, they were too much for this lazy guy. Just a bit too twitchy and
too sensitive.</p>
<p>This plane? It flew just like a Grumman. Perfect control harmony. Perfect, light forces on both elevator and ailerons. It fit like a glove.</p>
<p>Then, that night, by the way, I started seriously reconsidering building a Skybolt (BTW, this site was started as a Builder's Log for a Skybolt).
I flew one, and while I still liked the plane, I liked the Charger even more.</p>
<p>Especially with it's more &quot;classic&quot; looks (and come on, admit it, we pick biplanes for looks), and it's perfect flyability.</p>
<p>In 2017, we did Beer'o'Clock at my camp (I forget why.. maybe the Charger wasn't around).</p>
<p>And later that year, Glenn told me he's thinking about selling it. He got too much stuff on his hands, and didn't want to neglect the Grand Champion.</p>
<p>I thought for about a day. I loved <a class="reference external" href="http://79ft.net/tag/9891u.html">my Cheetah</a>, and I loved the fact that it was a &quot;normal&quot; airplane. I could take my 2 year old son up
in it. Not in a biplane. I could take &quot;normal&quot; people up in a Cheetah. Not in an open cockpit biplane - at least, it's a bit more.. rough, shall we say?</p>
<p>But I couldn't let the plane I loved just be sold on the Barnstormers; so the next day I told Glenn I'll take care of her when the time comes. I was overwhelmed,
and honored to have a chance of taking care of a piece of aviating and homebuilding history.</p>

<h2>The Plane</h2>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">The MA5 Charger</p><p>She was built in 1982. From what I could gather, she was started in 1977. There were two guys who built two MA5 Chargers in a chickenhouse in Petaluma, CA.
Glenn's plane was built by Remo Galeazzi, and won the Golden Lindy in 1987. The other Charger won too by the way, some years earlier :).</p>
<p>Remo wrote a <a class="reference external" href="/pdfs/chicken-house-chargers.pdf">really nice article for Sport Aviation about both planes</a>.</p>
<p>Here's <a class="reference external" href="/pdfs/remos-charger.pdf">another article about the plane</a>.</p>
<p>Glenn changed it a bit, adding the smoke system, changing the prop to wood, and tweaking the induction and fuel systems. But the plane stayed all original
mostly - original engine, original fabric, and such.</p>
<p>Oh, and it's <em>the</em> Charger <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marquart_MA-5_Charger">on Wikipedia</a> :)!</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="logistics">
<h2>Logistics</h2>
<p>I told Glenn to give me 6 months heads up, so that I could work out the logistics.</p>
<p>See, I have lots of hours to be very comfy flying any common tricycle single. I didn't have enough experience to haul a <em>taildragger bipe</em> across the country
(Glenn moved to CA by then). I would have to learn how to fly it comfortably before embarking on the trip; and figure out the logistics.</p>
<p>But then, things went much faster than I thought.</p>
<p>At Oshkosh 2018, Glenn was telling me he's about to sell the plane. I realized I didn't have time to train enough, and that it would be better to train
in the Charger from the getgo. So the working plan became me renting a large-ish truck, and hauling the airplane over to Texas with wings off.</p>
<p>And then, Glenn offered to fly the plane over himself, as a good bye to her. I couldn't refuse.</p>
<p>September 2018, Glenn told me he's gonna fly the plane over soon. I put the Cheetah up for sale, and
<a class="reference external" href="http://79ft.net/entries/2018-11-21-bye/">said my last goodbyes to her</a> November 21, 2018. Then, life and weather intervened, and we couldn't set the
trip up till last weekend.</p>
<p>'It's warming up', Glenn texted me a week and a half ago.</p>
<p>A week after that text, he was wheels up en route to TX, with Judi in the front hole.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-trip">
<h2>The Trip</h2>
<p>That didn't last long. An hour and change later, Glenn was stuck in Bakersfield, just at the southern tip of Central Valley, CA. All mountain passes
were blocked by low ceilings...</p>
<p>What's funny was that I was flying.. strike that, being flown from San Jose to Los Angeles, continuing to Texas, the same day Glenn and Judi were stuck at Bakersfield. I saw the damn
clouds blocking the passes. They were maybe a mile wide!!!</p>
<p>This delayed them by about 24 hours, but the rest of the trip was fairly smooth. They did a lot of flying after being stuck in Bakersfield for practically a whole day, and
some hours the following day.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Somewhere in the desert...</p><p>Saturday, March 23, at around 10:30 AM Central, they touched down at my home field. We had very little time - their flight back home was in a few hours. Glenn
walked me thru the basics. We tucked the airplane away.</p>

<div class="section" id="fin">
<h2>Fin</h2>
<p>It was all so fast, I was in the state of... denial? and disbelief? I started becoming overwhelmed when I got back home in the evening on that day, and opened up the
logbooks.</p>
<p>Remo's signatures and flight log.</p>
<p>Remo's letters.</p>
<p>Glenn's signatures and notes.</p>
<p>The letter from Remo to Glenn, with a bunch of pictures - just pictures of this Charger being built; mundane almost; but a part of the Champion's history.</p>
<p>I ended up writing this into my logbook:</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">First 6781G log entry in my log book</p><p>I now am a caregiver of a piece of aviation, homebuilding, and EAA's history.</p>
<p>And, I am no longer planeless! She needs a bit of cleaning and a touch of TLC, and to learning how to fly her we go!</p>
