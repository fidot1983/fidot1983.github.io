<p>They took a long time to show up, and then I was working on this amongst other things. Just finished now :).</p>
<p>So, right to it, shall we?</p>
<p>First things first was to get thru the firewall. I had these fancy penetration trims for cables called 'CableSafe' from Spruce</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Throttle cable with it</p><p>Hmm... problem one. Washers clearly won't fit given the old holes in the firewall (Remo had grommets there, but I wanted
something a bit more substantial).</p>
<p>No worries - we'll make me a special washer!</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2020-02-21-carb-finished/c-2.jpg" title="Special washer" >

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Cabin side of the firewall</p><p>And then, came fiddling. Most of it was done before ordering the cables, but I still wanted to check and re-check everything.</p>
<p>Hooked the clevis ends to the control cables, and the cables to the carb to verify everything.</p>
<p>When measuring, I figured I'd need a rod end for the mixture arm due to misalignment of the cable rod and the control arm. And
the damn bushing, too - because the hole in the carb is 1/4&quot;, and the bolt is #10. I got some bushing stock from McMaster, but
it was too long - had to shorten it with some creative sanding.</p>

   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2020-02-21-carb-finished/c-8-thumb.jpg" title="Airbox - do you see it?" alt="Airbox - do you see it?" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Airbox - do you see it?</p><p>See how it's tilted to the right (clockwise)?</p>
<p>I spent quite a bit of time there trying to figure out what's wrong. I put the cowling back on!!</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2020-02-21-carb-finished/c-10.jpg" title="With cowling" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2020-02-21-carb-finished/c-10-thumb.jpg" title="With cowling" alt="With cowling" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">With cowling</p><p>Still crooked.</p>
<p>I kept thinking and thinking. It's motor -&gt; oil sump -&gt; carb -&gt; airbox -&gt; filter. That's how everything's bolted together. The first three are not &quot;home buit&quot;, so I didn't think they were off. So it must've been the airbox and / or the filter mount.</p>
<p>Upon closer examination, I realized that the airbox was welded together way off, and is crooked itself. And the filter is mounted
even more crooked in the same clockwise direction.</p>
<p>To confirm, searched all the pics I could find online of the plane prior to my having it (and disassembling the front).</p>
<p>It was hard to tell, but.. I think it was like this from the very beginning.</p>
<p>Phew.</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>Meanwhile, we had a night of a kind of weather when it rains without actually raining - you know, as if you are in a cloud with
large droplets. Everything in the hangar got soaked, obviously. Including my clevis ends.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2020-02-21-carb-finished/c-11.jpg" title="Rust on a new rod end?!" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2020-02-21-carb-finished/c-11-thumb.jpg" title="Rust on a new rod end?!" alt="Rust on a new rod end?!" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Rust on a new rod end?!</p><p>Aren't they supposed to be cad plated? Oh; and that was the first time I really noticed how cad plating sacrifices itself to prevent
rust on steel - a lot of my hardware was covered in little white stains, which were cadmium having corroded and saved steel.</p>
<p>At any rate, I double checked the order paperwork. &quot;Cad plated&quot;. Hmmmm. They definitely were <em>not</em>.</p>
<p>Called Spruce. She checked and doublechecked - and confirmed that indeed, their vendor stopped doing cad plated clevis forks specifically in that dimension - #10 end, #10 rod. They refunded my money, and let me keep the forks.</p>
<p>Called SkyGeek, asking about the clevis forks they sell. The lady goes, &quot;yep, plated&quot;. I ask her to triple-confirm.</p>
<p>She takes about 10 minutes, and gets back to me - nope, not plated. She's sorry. No longer made.</p>
<p>John F., a local IA, confirmed. Only plain steel now, seems that cad plated forks are unobtanium. Crap! Oh well, I guess, paying
attention and making sure to put oil or something similar on them from time to time is in my future.</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>Glenn had a carb temp probe in the Rotec TBI I am replacing, and I decided to try to keep it. Wire was cut way too short for how
everything's on the carb (vs. the TBI), so I spent a bit of time pondering if:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The probe was a thermistor, or a thermocouple</li>
<li>If latter, could I successfully extend it</li>
</ul>
<p>Pouring thru (mostly AeroLectric Bob Nuckoll's) notes on thermocouples, realized that some are magnetic. Let's see.. score!
Magnetic indeed.</p>
<p>Got some multi-strand thermocouple wire of the same kind (red/yellow - I forget which metals those are :) ), and did some &quot;back-bench&quot;
testing.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Hook up the probe direct to the gauge</li>
<li>Pour solvent onto the probe tip, watch for rate of temp change and lowest point</li>
<li>Extend the wire now, do the pour again</li>
<li>Subjectively decide if the indications were &quot;roughly matching&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>They seemed to have been indeed matching, so I decided to attempt to keep the probe.</p>
<p>But, problem. It'd interfere with the airbox'es mounting bracket (and for some reason, I didn't take a picture of that :( ).</p>
<p>So first, let's cut a slot that will let that bracket clear the wire.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2020-02-21-carb-finished/c-13.jpg" title="Slot" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2020-02-21-carb-finished/c-13-thumb.jpg" title="Slot" alt="Slot" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Slot</p><p>A bit of drilling, a bit of hacksawing, and a bit of filing.</p>
<p>Then,</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2020-02-21-carb-finished/c-15.jpg" title="Trial fit" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2020-02-21-carb-finished/c-15-thumb.jpg" title="Trial fit" alt="Trial fit" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Trial fit</p><p>Nope, still not good. The carb temp probe there is the little thing that looks like a bolt with a wire sticking out of it -
and it's hex was interfering a bit. But we cleared the wire now.</p>
<p>So, a touch more cutting was in order.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2020-02-21-carb-finished/c-18.jpg" title="A touch more cutting" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2020-02-21-carb-finished/c-18-thumb.jpg" title="A touch more cutting" alt="A touch more cutting" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">A touch more cutting</p><p>... and it fit.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Since I was messing with the airbox, needed to finish one last thing on it.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2020-02-21-carb-finished/c-19.jpg" title="Carb heat bowden bracket" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2020-02-21-carb-finished/c-19-thumb.jpg" title="Carb heat bowden bracket" alt="Carb heat bowden bracket" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Carb heat bowden bracket</p><p>That bracket holds the carb heat bowden cable. Notice something weird? Yep, castellated <em>shear nuts</em> and <em>pins</em>. And, no, they weren't
tight either, so the whole bracket business was wobbling around.</p>
<p>I spent quite some time pondering why would it be set up like that. Castellated, pin, not tight, wobble - all of that adds up to
&quot;he wanted that bracket to move around&quot;. It adds up really well too! The setup makes total sense if he wanted to have this
arm move around - but there is absolutely no reason for it to do that! In fact, it's not good at all - steel bracket with steel bolts
moving around holes drilled thru aluminum airbox - that would elongate and tear up those holes!</p>
<p>I decided that no. It should not move around, in fact. So,</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2020-02-21-carb-finished/c-21.jpg" title="Hardware replaced" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2020-02-21-carb-finished/c-21-thumb.jpg" title="Hardware replaced" alt="Hardware replaced" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Hardware replaced</p><p>--</p>
<p>And then, the final hookups of everything after a long break. Routed the cables, and hooked them up with adel clamps where necessary
(doing that conforms them to their final shape, which causes some changes in positions of the cable and controls and the range of
motion).</p>
<p>Then, fine-tuned positioning of the controls, and tightened the pivot bolt on the bellcranks. Clevis pins might still need to come out
- and that's why cotter pins aren't bent yet - just in case I'll need to unhook them again.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Sealed the big gaps</p><p>I wanted to stuff all the gaps with  as much of this stuff as I could. I'll probably come back later
with much more of the FireBarrier to put a good layer of it around this and other firewall penetrations.</p>
<p>And then, and then... Oh yeah! I could torque the throttle arm nut, and pin that in place!</p>

<hr class="dashed"/><p>Even before Oshkosh, I have decided to replace the Rotec TBI the Charger had when I got it with a good old MA4-SPA carb. In short,
I do not trust the damn thing - especially with it being the sole component providing two out of three vertices
of the proverbial fire triangle to the motor. That reminds me, I need to summarize my thoughts on Rotec...</p>
<p>Regardless, one of the things  I got at Oshkosh was a rebuilt MA4-SPA from Spruce, and it was sitting in the
hangar waiting it's turn. I knew I would need to order new control cables for it, so I decided to get that going, after
all the alternator business was finished, because getting those cables will take me a bit.</p>
<p><em>Here's a fun aside. I knew this motor had a MA4 carb and Glenn &quot;upgraded&quot; it to the Rotec TBI. What I didn't
know was precisely what kind of MA4-SPA it had (and there are quite a few models of that carb).</em></p>
<p><em>No problem. At Oshkosh, I went to nice folks from Tempest (which now owns MA Carbs) and had a very nice conversation with them.
I asked if I should buy the carb from them, and they recommended Spruce instead, because it would be cheaper that way.
And, they mentioned the $600 core charge (I'll spell this out - you must provide a good &quot;core&quot; (old carburetor) or get
charged extra six hundred bucks). Ouch.</em></p>
<p><em>Ha! thought I. I am at Oshkosh! What could be easier than getting an old carburetor, especially since it's one of the
most widespread models? No problem at all!</em></p>
<p><em>Laughing, I ran that by guys from Tempest. They laughed with me, and actually were very very very helpful, telling me
what to look for when picking up an old carb.</em></p>
<p><em>No cracks in the body. Control arms should be present. Threads nice and not torn up. Venturi present. Etc etc etc.</em></p>
<p><em>Well, to the FlyMart we went, and sure enough, on a bench there laid a number of MA4-SPAs present, ranging from
$250 to $450. Of course, I picked up the $250 one (it was yellowtagged by the way! In 1995, if I recall), dragged it
over to Spruce, ordered a new carb, and handed them the old one I just picked up. So, $350 saved in about half a mile
of walking. Not bad!</em></p>
<p>Here it is, in all it's glory, hooked up to my motor. You guys should admire my &quot;economizer design&quot; gasket. Hmm... I need to patent that and start selling them for $100/pop. <em>Your fuel costs will go to 0! Now, you might not be going too far... but..
Fuel costs! Zero! With all the benefits, not going anywhere is such an insig....</em> Ahem.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Carb</p><p>Well, okay. The carb was on, and cables came next.</p>
<p>The Rotec had it's control cables for mixture and throttle done completely differently than the carb. Glenn reused Throttle
cable for Mixture on the TBI - it worked out well. He added a new cable, routed completely differently, for the TBI's
Throttle.</p>
<p>Since this motor was originally carbureted, all I had to do is reverse engineer a bit the way Remo did the hookups.</p>
<p>Hehe.</p>
<p>Well, Throttle on the carb side wasn't that bad.</p>

(in fact, it must have some extra &quot;padding&quot; in it) to move the throttle stop to stop. Boy, was I in for a treat.</p>
<p>This Charger has <em>reversing</em> throttle quadrants, meaning that when the throttle goes forward,
the actual control is pulled  backward. Since forward on the control must translate into forward on the carburetor, the
Charger has bellcranks to reverse the motion once again. These bellcranks are also a nice spot to tune out the <em>range</em>
of motion.</p>

   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-09-01-carb-cables/c-3-thumb.jpg" title="Control linkage" alt="Control linkage" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Control linkage</p><p>See, the relative distance of the top and bottom holes on the bellcrank to it's pivot point &quot;convert&quot; whatever range
of motion is on the control (throttle quadrant) side to an appropriate range of motion on the carburetor side.</p>
<p>And Glenn changed them.</p>
<p>Not a surprise. The Rotec TBI had it's controls set up very differently as compared to a carb. Notice how in the picture
the color of those bellcranks is somewhat off from the rest of the fuselage? That was my first clue...</p>
<p>My second clue was finding one of those bellcrank plates (minus the bearing) in the box of parts that I got with the airplane.</p>
<p>My third clue was me not being able to get the full range on the throttle.</p>
<p>Crap!</p>
<p>I am absolutely not set up to redo the bellcranks. Though they look simple, unless I want to make them from 3/16&quot; steel, which
would make them very, very, VERY heavy, I'd need a TIG welder. Or to MacGyver things with washers. And do quite a lot of
trial and error.</p>
<p>I wanted to see if I could luck out.</p>
<p>Credit goes to Glenn here - he made his new bellcranks <em>perfect</em> for the TBI. The range of motion on them was just right...
for the TBI. Because of that, they were asymmetrical - so I thought; maybe, just <em>maybe</em>, if I was to try them in different
combinations, I would luck out...</p>
<p>And I did!</p>
<p>Now, these two paragraphs of text and one picture is me describing... about 3 or 4 hours of work - tweaking cables,
turning bellcranks, checking, rinsing, and repeating. I think I did find a combination of orientation of these that gave
me <em>acceptable</em> (but by no means perfect) ranges of motion. I think I lost about an inch on both of the controls, but
that's not so bad, after all - you want extra room in your control's range of movement to make absolutely positive
you can move the controlled thing stop to stop.</p>
<p>Okay, Mixture's next.</p>
<p>I hooked up the cable that Glenn used for throttle to the mixture control on the carb, to use as a &quot;mock up&quot;,
and kinda fished it thru.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-09-01-carb-cables/c-1-4.jpg" title="Mixture cable hookup" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-09-01-carb-cables/c-1-4-thumb.jpg" title="Mixture cable hookup" alt="Mixture cable hookup" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Mixture cable hookup</p><p>I had to use a rod end here. The cable wouldn't line up with the control arm on the carb for me to be able to
use a Clevis there.... See how angled and offset that hookup is? I think Remo had a solid bowden cable style control
there...</p>
<p>Another problem with the Mixture control is that the carb's arm has a 1/4&quot; hole.. the rod ends need a #10 screw; which
means that the hole on the carb arm is too large. No biggie though, I'll add a bushing to reduce it.</p>
<p>Yet another problem is that the bolt's head is way too close to the carb bowl, and I had to have it reversed like
that (bolt &quot;upside down&quot;).</p>
<p>There's not a lot of room on the top either. Planning to  fix this problem with using of 1/2
size shear nut, and figuring out the exact bolt length (I ordered every bolt between -4 and -10 sizes).</p>
<p>And now, the routing of those cables.</p>
<p>The throttle cable routing was a given. I did not like too tight a radius in one of it's &quot;turns&quot;.</p>
<p>I wanted to try to optimize the routing..... ha. Good luck there buddy! The battery box gets in the way (the battery is
in a completely wrong place on this plane... it's reversed with the oil cooler. Oil cooler should be on the left. Battery
on the right. This makes controls routing a breeze. But no.....).</p>
<p>I wanted to make sure to keep the mixture cable to not be too close to the beefy 4 AWG cable that will go from
the battery to the master relay.</p>
<p>I had to reverse engineer previous routing of the cable, and figure out the best points to hook it up to the firewall.</p>
<p>I wanted to have my ANL fuse bases close to the master and starter relay. Ha! No way, with the control cables
the way they would have to be.</p>
<p>All this was an exercise in misery, and lots and lots of time. I wanted too much.</p>
<p>In the end, the routing of the throttle will stay the same; the cable will just be shortened to make one of the
turn radiusii bigger. The mixture will go nearby, and curl around the battery box.</p>
<p>I will not be able to use any other arrangement of solenoids and will have to stick to the old one. What's worse,
I will not be able to use the new solenoid I got from B&amp;C - it's mounting holes are very different, and, frankly,
it's not worth it to drill more holes in already a sieve-like firewall - I'll stick with the classic &quot;style&quot;.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Approx. new routing</p><p>The mixture cable does look like it'll interfere with the solenoids, I know. In the final setup, it will be pulled
away from the firewall and clamped to a couple of points I found.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>More bad news? I long noticed a leak from the left brake bleeder valve; and decided to add a new valve to my next order from Spruce.
I thought it was a basic valve problem. Well,  went to look for it's dimensions, and found out the source of the damn
leak, actually... Looks like someone tried to fix a leak there by making a bigger leak. The fun thing was, I didn't notice
this before - the brake was too dirty...</p>

<hr class="dashed"/><p>So after <a class="reference external" href="http://79ft.net/entries/2019-05-16-fire-hazard/">having discovered the electrical mess</a>, I realized that she's gonna be sitting
for a while.</p>
<p>Which meant...</p>
<p>Pickle time! Damn, this pickling thing is becoming a thing, excuse my tautologies...</p>
<p>I had to put her together enough to be able to run the engine to circulate and
warm up pickling oil.</p>
<p>And she was apart. With intakes off, TBI almost off, no oil, and such.</p>
<div class="section" id="fuel-intakes">
<h2>Fuel / Intakes</h2>
<p>So first, it was to be intakes.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-05-17-race-for-the-engine/p-2.jpg" title="RTV where there should be none" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-05-17-race-for-the-engine/p-2-thumb.jpg" title="RTV where there should be none" alt="RTV where there should be none" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">RTV where there should be none</p><p>Somebody put RTV to &quot;seal&quot; the intake gasket. Oh well.</p>
<p>Did you know that those 1 1/2 inch rubber hoses that go on intake tubes
are much easier with very thin coat of oil?</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-05-17-race-for-the-engine/p-5.jpg" title="Oiling the hoses" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-05-17-race-for-the-engine/p-5-thumb.jpg" title="Oiling the hoses" alt="Oiling the hoses" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Oiling the hoses</p><p>And then, it was the TBI.</p>
<p>Recall that when I was <a class="reference external" href="http://79ft.net/entries/2019-05-17-annual/">putting her apart</a>, I found pipe dope on the TBI inlet port?</p>
<p>Let me explain.</p>
<p>Fuel goes into gascolator. Then it branches: one branch goes to the engine driven pump, the other goes to the electric pump. Then, they go to the regulator on the TBI. Then, a couple of 90 degree fittings feed it into the TBI's inlet port, which has the &quot;last chance&quot; screen in it.</p>
<p>That's the port here, right above the airflow straightener:</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-05-17-race-for-the-engine/p-1.jpg" title="TBI from the down low" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-05-17-race-for-the-engine/p-1-thumb.jpg" title="TBI from the down low" alt="TBI from the down low" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">TBI from the down low</p><p>See that white gunk? That's Teflon dope. &quot;Aircraft grade&quot;; whatever.</p>
<p>Here's the problem.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-05-17-race-for-the-engine/p-4.jpg" title="TBI inlet hole" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-05-17-race-for-the-engine/p-4-thumb.jpg" title="TBI inlet hole" alt="TBI inlet hole" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">TBI inlet hole</p><p>Fuel has to go there, into that inlet hole. That's what the screen fitting screws into. Right past that, inside the TBI itself, there's a turn, another turn, and
a spray bar that sprays gas into the intake, injection-style, thru a tube
with a bunch of tiny holes. That's why there are screens in the fuel system:
to prevent gunk from clogging up those tiny holes.</p>
<p>So now, what happens when you take a <em>male</em> fitting out of a <em>female</em> threaded hole, and the fitting was doped? Some of that stuff ends up on the female portion. Next time the fitting is put in, dope remnants will be pushed in past the engaged threads, and possibly clog up the works.</p>
<p>Not. Good. At. All.</p>
<p>That's why there is the copper crush gasket behind that screen fitting - to seal it to the TBI body w/o requiring anything extra. You can kinda see that gasket all
smudged around with that dope on the first picture.</p>
<p>So I had to deal with it.. Clean it out somehow.</p>
<p>It was crumbly, but sticky enough to not want to come out.</p>
<p>I tried every solvent on hand. Nope.</p>
<p>I tried carefully scraping it out with a dental probe. Yeah, kinda worked,
but I wasn't satisfied.</p>
<p>I tried every solvent in my buddy Dick's hangar. Nope.</p>
<p>In desperation, I drove to the local Home.. strike that, Aerospace, Depot, thinking
about picking up every kind of solvent they had and I didn't.</p>
<p>And then, I remembered this:</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-05-17-race-for-the-engine/p-3.jpg" title="Goof-OFF!" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-05-17-race-for-the-engine/p-3-thumb.jpg" title="Goof-OFF!" alt="Goof-OFF!" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Goof-OFF!</p><p>I don't know what kind of concoction that is; but it worked! The hole was clean.
Next time was a couple days after, and when I got back to the hangar, I discovered that it has turned into a lake :(</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-05-17-race-for-the-engine/p-7.jpg" title="Lake in my hangar" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-05-17-race-for-the-engine/p-7-thumb.jpg" title="Lake in my hangar" alt="Lake in my hangar" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Lake in my hangar</p><p>Grading's all screwed up around our hangars, and when we get lots and lots of
rain, they flood. Not too much though, luckily. This was the second time in
the past few weeks - first time, I had my tools scattered around the floor.
This time, I was smarter...</p>
<p>Anyway, back to the TBI. The rest of it went together quite nicely. I discovered
that there was TorqueSeal put on the idle mixture screw.</p>
<p>Why? No idea. That screw is spring loaded. Should stay put.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-05-17-race-for-the-engine/p-6.jpg" title="Torque Seal where there should be none" >

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Torque Seal where there should be none</p><p>I wanted to flush the lines and then the TBI to make absolutely sure
none of that dope went it. The best way to do that would be with the electrical
pump; but I'm a one man show.... and the switch for it is 5 feet away from the
firewall.</p>
<p>So, I had to rig me up a little doodad.</p>

<p>I borescoped the engine (looked alright - I'll post a report about this later,

<p>Pickling oil was mixed up next, and into the engine it went.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">A recipe for a mess...</p><p>After filling the sump up, it was time to check for oil pressure. Lycoming
tells you in SB1241C  to pre-oil your engine by cranking with the starter in
10-30 second bursts until oil pressure comes up to 20 PSI.</p>
<p>Well, oil pressure gauge on the Charger is finicky, so I wanted it to at least
move.</p>
<p>Oh wait. She has an ignition/start switch. No way I can use that to crank and
not have a hot mag w/o messing with P-Leads.</p>
<p>Crap.</p>
<p>Also, I might want to crank from around the firewall (the prop was still off).</p>
<p>But I had my pushbutton doodad!</p>
<p>So I rigged it up to the starter solenoid this time.</p>
<p>Of course I misunderstood the way the starter solenoid was wired.</p>
<p>It had two terminals.</p>
<p>I thought one of them was ground; with the wire going to the firewall.
The other then was supposed to be positive.</p>
<p>That didn't work.</p>
<p>I measured it - between those terminals - nothing. &quot;Dead starter solenoid&quot;,
I though. Crap! It was 8pm. Auto parts stores were closing soon.</p>
<p>I rushed to a nearby O'Reilly. Picked up a starter solenoid. Went back.</p>
<p>Measured it too. NOTHING? How come? Something was amiss.</p>
<p>Only then I started suspecting that something was off. That other terminal on
the original starter solenoid I was hooking my positive wire to was all
corroded and looked like it never had a nut.</p>
<p>OH! The way it's supposed to be wired is that positive goes to the <em>same</em>
terminal where that wire I thought to have been ground was. It wasn't a
ground wire - it was a <em>diode</em>. And the ground was off of the case of the
solenoid.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So, we're cranking now.</p>
<p>30 seconds. No pressure.
30 more. No pressure. Crap!</p>
<p>I unhooked the oil pressure sending hose (the one that hooks up to the line
that goes to the gauge).</p>
<p>Crank. No oil. A couple bubbles is all I got.</p>
<p>CRAP!</p>
<p>The oil pump de-primed itself?</p>
<p>Kinda makes sense I guess? The plane was sitting for way too long :(</p>
<p>So, I took off the oil cooler return line. Dumped another quart of oil in there.</p>
<p>I had this hose fitting that goes on top of an oil bottle that was very neatly
set up to mate with the engine oil hose's flare: so I could squeeze the bottle and push the oil in.</p>
<p>After the whole quart, I re-hooked the line back onto the oil cooler, and tried
again.</p>
<p>Success! Now, I saw oil coming out of the oil pressure sending hose.</p>
<p>Hooked it up to the gauge line, and saw the gauge move, finally. Good.</p>
<p>Damn, with all that cranking I ran out my old battery I had put in there.</p>
<p>Now, have to flip the battery (to put in the good one - the flying one - I always use my old battery from the Cheetah when I mess with electrical, not to abuse the actual &quot;production&quot; battery).</p>
<p>Now, the top spark plugs go back in, the ignition wires get hooked up.</p>
<p>Prop time!</p>
<p>Bolt one - start it in.
Bolt two.
Bolt three.</p>
<p>Bolt 4. Doesn't go in? Not even a chance? What the hell?</p>
<p>I pulled the prop back off and laid it down. Put the front crush plate on top
(that one positions the bolts).</p>
<p>No matter what I did, there'd be at least 3 out of 6 bolts that won't go in.
This time, it was a few dry days, and I guess the prop moved enough to
have the &quot;top&quot; and &quot;bottom&quot; holes (if looking at the prop horizontally) move
closer together. It was off by almost a 1/16th.</p>
<p>So here I was. With an engine that was cranked for a total of a few minutes,
and probably had scraped a lot of oil off of cam lobes and lifters.</p>
<p>With a prop.</p>
<p>I couldn't put on.</p>
<p>Which I needed.</p>
<p>To fire the damn thing up.</p>
<p>It was late. I tidied up, and went home.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-prop">
<h2>The Prop</h2>
<p>I wrote a note to Frank Johnson who made the prop that same night, and called him the next day.</p>
<p>He wasn't surprised. &quot;Redrill&quot; is a simple fix.</p>
<p>But I was a bit apprehensive, and this was a nice excuse to meet him. He's
2 hours away from me. We agreed to meet in a few days, at the first time
he was available.</p>
<p>So, the engine with oil scraped off the lobes had to sit for another couple
days.</p>

The rest of it? Well, what can two guys who're crazy about airplanes do
at one of those guys' shop and hangar? Hmm... What could we do? :)</p>
<p>The weather was swell, and I was in a good mood - and airport was on the way
back from Frank's.</p>
<p>So, I went straight to the airport.</p>
<p>The prop went on beautifully.</p>

<hr class="dashed"/><p>No posts for 1 month and 5 days! Holy cow.</p>
<p>That's all been eaten up by a couple projects. One of them ended up being a complete redraw of all airfoil sections on the lower wings on the Skybolt; and nothing to write about (no pretty pictures, very routine work). Just lots and lots of cleanup.</p>
<p>Another one... was me following an old Russian tradition.</p>
<p>You see, during long winter months Russians' desire for fruit and vegetables (and mushrooms) is satisfied with pickled everything. Cucumbers, tomatoes, cabbage, grape leaves, dill (!), apples, garlic, fish (haha :) ), and other things which I don't know English words for.</p>
<p>My genes are calling. It's fall, and I had to pickle me something.</p>
<p>It was.. a disassembled Lycoming for the Skybolt!</p>
<p>Some weeks ago, a gentleman posted on the Forum about him selling an O-360-A4M, all overhauled, yellowtagged, and such, by Superior; with higher compression pistons from ECI, with everything needed to put it together minus the sump and accessories, for a very attractive price.</p>
<p>Best part was, it was disassembled, so I am to get all the fun putting it together without the disassembling and sending parts out for overhaul (and well, paying for that too :)).</p>
<p>In short, it was a great deal.</p>
<p>The problem? Well, I will not need it for quite a while. 10 years maybe, if I go with the speed I'm currently going at.</p>
<p>I figured, assembling and pickling it after would be a bad proposition. A much better one would be to pickle it part by part.</p>
<p>As usual, started with a <a class="reference external" href="http://www.biplaneforum.com/showthread.php?t=10628">thread on the Biplane Forum</a>.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, I ended up using three things.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Phillips Anti-Rust Oil</li>
<li>STP</li>
<li>Cortec CorrShield VpCI-368</li>
</ul>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Cortec CorrShield VpCI-368</p><p>This latter substance is amazing. It's mineral spirits soluble, moisture displacing spray-on stuff that can protect up to 2 years in outside (!!!) storage. I'm storing the engine parts inside my house, so I figured it will do very good for a much bigger number of years.</p>
<p>It sprays on, and then dries over a couple days to consistency of candlewax. A bit sticky, but very tough. They claim it's scratch resistant.</p>
<p>Just in case I missed something or ended up scratching it off; I decided to also put a thick layer of Aeroshell grease on everything that's covered with CorrShield. Just in case.</p>
<p>And then...</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">.. all bagged up</p><p>But after them sitting like that for a couple days, I didn't like how all the oil drained to the bottom of the baggies. So instead, I submerged everything in 2 oil/STP baths.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Pushrods, piston rings, tappets, etc in oil/STP bath</p><p>At this point, I ran out of oil and STP... And I had too much of CorrShield and grease -- and, after playing for some time with CorrShield and seeing how tough it is, I decided to use it on everything that didn't get into oil baths; even on smaller parts.</p>
