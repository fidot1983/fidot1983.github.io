<hr class="dashed"/><p>About a week after engine start (yep, I took a break), back at the airport, and looking over the motor again, trying to
figure out what the hell was that electrical type smell...</p>
<p>One theory formed...</p>
<p>You see, I hung the exhaust with copious amounts of anti-seize. I do have either a Grumman or a Cessna style exhaust,
with 4 &quot;stubs&quot; (aka risers) coming off of the motor, and a &quot;spider&quot; looking setup hooking to them, joining all cylinders
into a muffler under the front of the motor.</p>
<p>Risers go inside the main exhaust, and are held by clamps, engaging &quot;beads&quot; on the pipes.</p>
<p>So I thought, I'd hang the whole thing &quot;loosely&quot;, so that individual cylinders will move, and use high-temp anti-seize to make sure
it, well, doesn't seize up.</p>
<p>The working theory was that that anti-seize was &quot;cooking&quot; and produced a smell. I saw a lot of it blown out from around the clamps.</p>
<p>Another working theory was that maybe there was an insect or few stuck around the baffles or cylinders somewhere. There was one
big wasp in there that I saw after the engine start - and smoldering insect carcasses sometimes smells just like burning wiring.</p>
<p>I know that last bit, because I spent insane amount of time, and got aggravated to no end, when I got this weird
electrical burning smell in my old house. I was convinced I hit a wire when hanging some stuff to the studs just a few
days before, and I literally drilled holes along every place where I hung things with a hole saw to make sure there were no wires.</p>
<p>There was one, but it wasn't pinched or damaged.</p>
<p>And all that was finally traced to a <em>roach</em> that died inside my air conditioner heat exchanger, right on a heat strip - heating
season just started, the roach was dead and smoldering, and the AC was blowing that lovely smell all over the house. I later read a lot of fire department stories about similar situations of people freaking out and thinking their houses were on fire.</p>
<p>At any rate. My theory was either the wasp, or the anti-seize.</p>
<p>And my anti-seize blew out of the joints real well (ha!) - sooo.. I guess, the loose hanging exhaust idea was a no go.</p>
<p>And, by the way.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2020-10-16-exhaust/e-2.jpg" title="Crack!" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2020-10-16-exhaust/e-2-thumb.jpg" title="Crack!" alt="Crack!" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Crack!</p><p>Damn.</p>
<p>So the exhaust was taken off, again.</p>
<p>After quite some researching, here's what I found.</p>
<p>I had 1 3/4 risers.</p>
<p>Those clamps are ubiquitous Cessna clamps. Part number irrelevant - because...</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2020-10-16-exhaust/e-4.jpg" title="Cessna clamps" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2020-10-16-exhaust/e-4-thumb.jpg" title="Cessna clamps" alt="Cessna clamps" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Cessna clamps</p><p>Grumman also has 1 3/4 risers.</p>
<p>I was convinced I had a Grumman exhaust, because hey, what'd you take: a Cessna or a Grumman? :)</p>
<p>Those clamps are impossible to make to not leak. Forums confirmed by the way. Mr. John F. confirmed, too. Just
think about them for a second - they <em>will</em> leak.</p>
<p>Grumman clamps are a bit different - they have this &quot;liner&quot; that is supposed to act as a gasket.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2020-10-16-exhaust/e-3.jpg" title="Grumman clamp" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2020-10-16-exhaust/e-3-thumb.jpg" title="Grumman clamp" alt="Grumman clamp" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Grumman clamp</p><p>Yep, you guessed. I went Grumman. I don't have any Cessna friends. I have a ton of Grumman friends. You know where my heart lies.</p>
<p>Grumman book does not state anything about hanging the exhaust &quot;loosely&quot;. It states to use Walker AcoustiSeal &lt;part number here that doesn't exist anymore&gt; (of course).</p>
<p>Mr. David Fletcher of Fletchair by the way confirmed that the exhaust needs to be tightened down, and that it's not a usual
problem with it cracking due to differential movement of cylinder heads. Or rather, of course it will crack. But not
all the time - it's perfectly fine.</p>
<p>We spent quite some time with Ben, figuring out the clamps (I was initially reluctant to fully close them because of the liner
deforming too much), and AcoustiSeal. He helped find a catalogue AcoustiSeal with a different part number - 35959 - that is definitely
within the temp range. I decided to use that instead of anti-seize. Researching a bit, it seems to &quot;burn up&quot; and &quot;ash out&quot; forming a
fluffy, powdery type seal.</p>
<p>Cleaned every pipe, put on the new clamps with AcoustiSeal, and tightened them down. That was bad. Really bad. Torque was definitely
excessive to close them, but I had to close them. It's obvious why, too - the OD of the pipe is 1 3/4; the ID of the clamp
is 1 3/4, but the thickness of the steel liner is about 1/64 - so yeah. And my pipes aren't perfectly round, or smooth, either.</p>
<p>But they did close, and they did fine in the end.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2020-10-16-exhaust/e-8.jpg" title="New clamps" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2020-10-16-exhaust/e-8-thumb.jpg" title="New clamps" alt="New clamps" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">New clamps</p><p>I decided to try them. Worst case, I'd go back to Cessna style.</p>
<p>Also, cleaned up around the smoke oil injectors, and put AcoustiSeal there too. You can see one on the picture above.
Re-safetied them a bit better too - the idea Glenn had was that if the main worm clamp failed, the safety wire will at least
hold them in place.</p>
<p>And then, the other question came up that we spent quite a bit of time arguing over with Ben.</p>
<p>What's the torque on the Lycoming exhaust nuts?</p>
<p>It's not listed. Stud driving torque is listed. It's listed for  <em>vertical</em> and <em>geared</em>  motors in relevant sections of SSP-1776 at 160-180.
Grumman book lists them at .. 110-140 if I recall correctly. The &quot;by the book&quot; application of &quot;default torque unless otherwise noted&quot; section of the &quot;Direct Drive Engine&quot; part would put it at 204-228. All inch pounds. So the range, depending on the source, would be 110-228 - a 100% difference. !!!</p>
<p>A lot of folks on the internet use the &quot;default&quot; - 204-228. A few were told to do so by Lycoming. When I torqued them, it felt...
somewhat excessive, given that there's a gasket in play there too. There's no straight answer, really.</p>
<p>I settled on 180. Why? Grumman's book assumes &quot;beaded&quot; - not &quot;no-blow&quot; - gaskets. 180 is much closer to 204. 12% difference - within
margin of error of a crappy typical torque wrench. And if mine is reading &quot;high&quot;, I'll still be in the range listed for geared and vertical motors - which have the same cylinders as far as I know.</p>
<p>Yep, convoluted.</p>
<p>Anyway, second run yielded a very different smell - this time, of the regular &quot;burning oil&quot; sensation (which is typical for a motor that slowly weeps oil and throws it everywhere when shaking - that's the built in feature of spray lubrication and corrosion protection of your motor compartment! What? You weren't aware of that?!).</p>
<p>Much better. No blowouts of sealant anymore. No exhaust leaks I could discern.</p>
<p>... and, an oily fitting that I thought was oily after the first run because we used it to pour oil into the oil pump - but no,
I confirmed a hose leak around the fitting of the only two hoses (oil cooler supply and return) I did <em>not</em> change.</p>
<p>Le sigh.</p>

<hr class="dashed"/><p>And so, we're onto the race to the first motor run. I am writing this about a month later - according
to the log, the motor was started up September 19, 2020.</p>
<p>But first...</p>
<div class="section" id="upfront">
<h2>Upfront</h2>
<p>Finish mounting the starter was no problem: clean up the threads, clean up the studs, torque, done.
Then, the alternator.</p>
<p>Belt tensioning... too annoying by hand, but it took me a while to stop trying and become sensible.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Belt Tensioning</p><p>You gotta safety two bolts over there, and I decided to make it nice: for the bottom (pivot) bolt, drilled a tiny
hole in the bracket lower than where the alternator would be, and for the top bolt attaching the bracket to the
motor... hmmm...</p>
<p>Somewhere on VansAirforce someone used a cherry rivet as a &quot;hookup&quot; point for the safety wire. I thought to one-up
that, and use a short #8 screw - drilling it's head.</p>
<p>Frankly, I didn't think it'd work out.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Drilled cap head</p><p>...but as you can see, it did.</p>
<p>So then, to the hole in the bracket. I needed a #8-32 tap.</p>
<p>Side, fun, story: quite a while ago I ended up bidding in a machine shop liquidation auction. Got quite a few nice things, including a very heavy duty bandsaw - and, <em>accidentally</em>, a massive cabinet full of tooling. Anything you could imagine: inserts, drills, taps, slitting saws, you name it. In all shapes and sizes. When we moved the cabinet, we emptied it into about 10 boxes, so ...  I <em>did</em> have a #8-32 tap. In fact, probably about 20 of them. Question was, which one of the boxes were they in.</p>
<p>... apparently, in the one on the top. Hmm. This kind of luck is unusual.</p>

   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2020-10-15-start/s-6-thumb.jpg" title="Tap" alt="Tap" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Tap</p><p>Look at it carefully. Does it look like a regular tap we are all used to?</p>
<p>Didn't to me either.</p>
<p>So to researching we went.</p>
<p>Aha! &quot;Threadforming&quot; tap. AKA &quot;Cold Rolling&quot;. So <em>that's</em> how they're done. Rolled threads are formed into the metal rather than cut; giving them superior strength. Basically, the tap shapes the metal, displacing it in the valleys and raising peaks.</p>
<p>Company that made these taps was advertising them for CNC milling. Well, what's a human if not a bio-CNC machine?!</p>
<p>Okay, problem number 2. I was pretty sure normal tap and drill chart values for hole diameters won't work; making too
small a hole. Hmm...</p>

<h2>Airbox</h2>
<p>That thing needed to be put back on, and carb final torqued with a new gasket. Cleaned it all up inside as much as I could, and had to cut a couple of special gaskets that I can't for the love of me figure out where to get (carb's base
is different size from the top - and this is an &quot;airframe&quot; problem - read, &quot;no standard part from Marvel or Lycoming I could find reasonably&quot;). No problem. Used the same material Lycoming used for their gaskets, ordered from McMaster, and made me a couple.</p>

Glenn had it on when he put on the Rotec TBI, and in the times of my research of TBIs, I have discovered that some folks claimed they helped on carbureted motors as well. Well, it definitely won't hurt - aside from my having to do two gaskets instead of one. No biggie.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="carb">
<h2>Carb</h2>
<p>One interesting thing that happened. I had to drain the carb bowl of all the preservative oil, and flush it, so I took
off the plug, drained it, and started putting it back in. Plug's an NPT thread with torque listed by Lycoming in SSP-1776 at 144 inch pounds.</p>
<p>Hmmm.. I noticed it was going in way deeper than it was in before, and way &quot;harder&quot; than when I took it out.</p>
<p>Hmmm.. Well, it's Lycoming, they know what the hell they're talking about. So in it went, at 144 inch/lbs.</p>
<p>But this bugged me. I think some other day I pulled out the Marvel's manual. 25-30 inch/lbs?! WHAT?!</p>
<p>Back to Lycoming. 144. Marvel (the makers of the carb)? 25-30. Damn it. Forums? Nothing interesting.</p>
<p>I finally figured it out. In SSP-1776, in the table for special torques, Lycoming lists the plug to have 3/4 pipe threads. Mine were 1/8 NPT. Lycoming's torque for those is 40-44 inch/lbs. Still higher than Marvel, but much closer now.</p>
<p>So, I undid the plug, that cut a bit of the tapered thread &quot;deeper&quot;, of course. And put it back in, with the right torque this time.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="other-stuff">
<h2>Other Stuff</h2>
<p>And then, minor stuff here and there. Cleaned and prepped spark plugs. Put the exhaust back on. Tightened things that
had to be tightened. Charged batteries. Tied up everything hanging loose. Gave the plane a good look all over.</p>
<p>We were ready for the final day. There were a number of things I needed two sets of hands for, and I had just the
man lined up.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="day-x-or-september-19-to-be-precise">
<h2>Day X - or, September 19, to be Precise.</h2>
<p>My buddy Mr. N. agreed to help, and be my observer and fireman (just in case). Mr. M. was extremely inquisitive about
how we're gonna be putting out a burning airplane, and I had to explain a number of times that the goal of
an exercise of starting a motor that's been idle for a year is not to have it go ablaze, and having a
fire watch nearby is a part of prudence, not expectations. He seemed to have been
disappointed. I would be too, if I was 5.</p>
<p>So, on a nice Saturday, we went to the airport.</p>
<p>First, drained all the pickling oil.
Took off the prop (because we'd have to spin the motor to pressurize the oil lines).
Put the fuel pump back on.
Tightened all new fuel lines, and leak checked them. Mr. M. used my fancy &quot;button with alligator clips&quot; to turn it on.
Put new oil in, primed the oil cooler and pump (and this is fun in this airplane, because there's no oil

Checked control cable travel, and final cotter pinned them.
Checked brakes again (though we bled them when I finished fixing them up).</p>
<p>Then, came the pressurization, and purging of oil lines, time. Mr. M insisted that he wants to &quot;press the button&quot; -
which would put +12V onto the starter contactor; bypassing my normal starting circuit (latter would make the
left mag hot, and I didn't want that).</p>
<p>I told him to press the button and hold it and not let go till I told him to.</p>
<p>Now, starters with a motor with removed spark plugs are fast, loud, and annoyingly sounding. Mr. M. pressed the button.
Jumped a bit. Grimaced a bit. He clearly didn't expect it. I didn't see it, Nick told me afterwards - I was watching
the oil line. I yelled &quot;Stop&quot; when I saw the oil come out, and looked at Mr. M - who, at that point, was shaking
and at the point of breaking down in tears. But! He didn't let go of the damn button. Man.</p>

<p>... back from lunch. Plane out. Wheels chocked. Brakes tested. Fire watch ready and instructed.</p>

<p>... second try: no primer, so I have to pump the throttle a bit.</p>
<p>... she's alive!!!!!</p>
<p>I let the temps go up just a bit, and called N. He confirmed everything seemed to have been fine. We shut down,
and went over every fluid fitting. All good.</p>
<p>Started her back up - I wanted to warm the oil to a reasonable temp and let her circulate for a bit, maybe 30
minutes - to get the juice flowing again.</p>
<p>On the second run, I revved her harder, and smelled something. Smelled like... burnt wiring?
N. went around the engine, all wires, and everything he could see or think was close to being to a hot surface,
or an electrical doodad. No signs of trouble.</p>
<p>We decided to proceed.</p>
<p>She ran just fine. I think we ran for about a total of 30 minutes. Shut her down, dragged her in. Went over the wires
again - all of them. Nothing, all clean. There were no bad indications on any of the electrical instrumentation, either.
So at that time, we left that as a mystery to be solved.</p>
<p>... and with that, we went home. We were tired.</p>

<hr class="dashed"/><p>Well, we're continuing happily with wiring over here :).</p>
<div class="section" id="wingtips">
<h2>Wingtips</h2>
<p>SkyBeacon and SkySensor were to replace the existing nav lights. Yes, I know, SkySensor is probably a gimmick. But what the hell.</p>
<p>Remo ran nav light wires in a -4 tubing along the front wing spar, using it as kind of a &quot;conduit&quot;, exiting the wires around the wingtip,
and just soldering them to the nav lights he used. Wires were ~3 ft too long, which is a fine &quot;service whip&quot;, but they were just laying on top of the
inside of the fabric of the wingtip. There are no access holes on the wingtip, so no way to get in to tie them up.</p>
<p>Oh well. We work with what we have.</p>
<p>I was going to shorten the wires, and because the lights are on the top wing, I didn't want to solder them - I'd be doing it off of a
ladder, very near if not <em>on</em> the wing's fabric... lots of things to go wrong.</p>
<p>The other thing I didn't want to happen was to have the connection points between the light's wire pigtails and wires in the wings to &quot;rattle
around&quot; the wingtip (with no way of tying them down).</p>
<p>So I had this brilliant idea. The pic is post-realizing the idea was a mistake, with HST cut off....</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2020-09-06-wiring-2/w-1.jpg" title="SkySensor, and cut off HST" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2020-09-06-wiring-2/w-1-thumb.jpg" title="SkySensor, and cut off HST" alt="SkySensor, and cut off HST" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">SkySensor, and cut off HST</p><p>The lights had this plastic tube coming out thru which the wires were routed. I would shorten the pigtails as much as I could (like on the picture
basically), hook'em up to the wing wires with barrel crimps, and put a long piece of my favorite glue-lined SCL tubing over them - with
it glueing itself to the plastic tube and to the wires, creating one rigid &quot;tube&quot; coming off of the light...</p>
<p>Boy was that a mistake.</p>
<p>The tubing glued itself to the wires alright - but not to the plastic tube. So the whole thing created a rattly &quot;lever&quot; that would pull the
wires thru that tube when vibrated - loading the soldered joints on the PCB of the SkySensor.</p>
<p>Not Good At All.</p>
<p>So that idea had to go to trash, and I had to cut the heatshrink off, carefully, with all the glue, without damaging the wires...</p>
<p>And ended up having to do exactly what I was trying to avoid - having rattling connections between the wing wires and the
light, and to solder them. Why solder? Well, because the barrel crimps are heavy, relatively speaking, and I didn't want those heavy &quot;bumps&quot;
bouncing around inside the wingtip, even with HST around them.</p>
<p>So, solder.</p>
<p>From the ladder, on top of the wing, covered in fabric.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Let there be light!</p><p>The other fun part? On the left side, Remo had standard 6-32 tapped holes in whatever the backing of the light socket for the navlight was
made out of. I couldn't really see - maybe a nutplate, maybe just tapped sheet metal.</p>
<p>But on the right side, he used sheet metal screws. Which, of course, I didn't know about till I started putting the lights on - because I
took apart the left side when checking if SkyBeacon will fit, and assumed the other side would be exactly the same. As usual, rookie mistake.
By now, I should know to check everything.</p>
<p>Well, that was a minor delay. Spruce / AN standard doesn't have screws with the right size head (#6 AN screws have heads too large to
fit on the SkyBeacon and SkySensor), so McMaster-Carr had to be resorted to to get the right size and length sheet metal screws.</p>

<div class="section" id="p-leads">
<h2>P-Leads</h2>
<p>The Charger has the Bendix mags, and the P-lead connectors on those are not ring-terminated; instead, using a &quot;screw in&quot; type deal.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2020-09-06-wiring-2/w-2.jpg" title="Bendix type p-lead connector - old wire" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2020-09-06-wiring-2/w-2-thumb.jpg" title="Bendix type p-lead connector - old wire" alt="Bendix type p-lead connector - old wire" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Bendix type p-lead connector - old wire</p><p>Basically, the shielded wire goes thru the outer bushing. The ferrule is a &quot;T&quot;-shaped sleeve, and shield get spread out over the &quot;shank&quot; of the
T. It's squished between the outer bushing's base and the &quot;flat&quot; of the T of the inner ferrule.</p>
<p>The center wire goes thru an insulating spacer (that brown piece), and thru a washer on the other end - with a &quot;button&quot; of solder built on
top of the washer to create a contact point.</p>
<p>The whole contraption gets screwed into the mag's receiving hole with the nut - ferrule rests against the mag's casing, pushing on the insulator
and the solder button to contact the contact point inside the mag, while the nut pushes on the outer bushing and clamps the shield between
it's base and the inner ferrule.</p>
<p>Now, that works with something like 16GA wire, and it's too big with my small 20GA P-leads. Also, notice how beat up the shield on that
setup is? That's the old P-lead.</p>
<p>Folks make adapters for these to go to ring terminals, but they run something like $100 per, which is just silly, so I was determined to
make this work.</p>
<p>Here was my idea, and what it looked like on the right mag. Note <em>two</em> P-lead wires - one of them goes to the front cockpit's tach.</p>
<p>We pigtail the shield.</p>

by .010 too small, to fit over that layer.</p>
<p>Damn.</p>
<p>After playing with various heatshrinks for the outer layer, and trying to slide the bushing on while the HST was hot, I gave up, and...</p>
<p>... just enlarged the hole in the bushing. Yes, I know. The bushing seems to be CAD plated, and I surely took it off (the bushing was magnetic). We'll see how it fares -
if I see rust, I can always buy the adapters for silly prices.</p>

<h2>FWF, finishing up</h2>
<p>And then, the rest of FWF. The only other interesting tidbit was my thinking about the Starter Warning light wire. It's one that goes off of
the &quot;I&quot; terminal of the starter contactor - which goes &quot;hot&quot; when the starter contactor closes - to indicate &quot;starter engaged&quot; with
a light. The whole shebang is probably superficial, but I convinced myself that I wanted it if for nothing else than to maintain &quot;symmetry&quot;
of lights on my panel.</p>
<p>Silly.</p>
<p>Anyway, that wire needed a fuse - though it's an intermittent wire, and I'll admit to thinking about maybe not having a fuse on it,
decided to do it, because it wouldn't harm a thing.</p>
<p>Used a 1A &quot;legged&quot; type PCB mount fuse there.</p>

<hr class="dashed"/><p>Well, damn. With almost a year (no, more than a year!) of my being a caretaker of the Chickenhouse Charger, I
finally was about to actually begin what I have started - which was, putting in <em>my</em> wires.</p>
<p>I decided to start at the switches, and run from the panel forward. Some wires will terminate at the fuse blocks
(power feeds), and some will go forward - to the front panel, voltage regulator, and firewall forward.</p>
<p>Then, I was planning to run a few wires backwards - the ones that were pre-terminated on my transducers (fuel,
oil pressures, oil temp, and mag pickup for the tach).</p>
<p>Immediately, I will admit: <strong>that was a mistake</strong>. While the harness turned out alright, it could've been
much neater - if I ran in one direction. I could've made sure the whole thing is wire to wire and perfectly
clean. So I should've run front to back, because my pre-terminated wires all &quot;started&quot; upfront.</p>
<p>In other words, prop to tail. Well sigh. Next time. On the other hand, this approach would've made terminating
switches at the panel a nightmare. That was, initially, the reason why I wanted to start at the panel - so that
I'd pre-attach wires to switches, tie them up, and then trim them at the other end.</p>
<p>At any rate.... Shall we?</p>
<div class="section" id="prep">
<h2>Prep</h2>
<p>Couple things to knock off before I started wiring was to complete the back panel. One thing that was
left was the compass correction card bracket. No problem, drilled and tapped a couple holes for #2 brass screws.</p>
<p>Here's Mr. M. installing it:</p>

shock (crash?) the switch breaks the circuit. I am.. not sure why he would have it, but he had it.</p>
<p>I considered not putting it back in, but what the hell.</p>

<h2>Panel</h2>
<p>Now ready, I decided to install the switches first, and then wire them from the back. I needed a couple short jumpers
though to connect them, and to set up some wires to be the exact length. That'd be impossible with switches
installed in the panel (too little access), so I set up an old placard plate, installed switches into it,
and worked on those jumpers and terminations on the bench before moving them to the airplane.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Engine starter engaged position - note that I can hit the starter and hold the throttle with the same hand</p><p>...when it dawned on me...</p>
<p>My three most important switches, L and R Mags, and Master, were set up with lockouts - you couldn't turn them on
just by clicking them, instead, having to pull the lever first to move it to the &quot;on&quot; position. I mostly
did that to protect from accidental too playful a kid in the cockpit.</p>
<p>But they weren't locked out in the &quot;on&quot; position!</p>
<p>Why is that important? Well, the Smoke and the Fuel Pump - the most <em>operated</em> switches on this plane - are
right there. Note how their levers are shorter? If I accidentally hit the longer levered Master, or a Mag, switch,
that would turn it <em>off</em> - with me potentially shutting down the motor. While a remote possibility, improving
the situation would amount to just replacing the switches to the ones with lockouts in <em>both</em> on <em>and</em> off positions.</p>
<p>I don't know how I missed that when designing the original setup...</p>
<p>I decided to do it.</p>
<p>So out came the switches, I had to un-wire the terminals from the back. In went the order for three new
switches with now correct lock-outs.</p>
<p>About a week later, I had them, and could proceed.</p>
<p>With left side wired up, I could tie it down. Mind you, access there is tight and from all kinds of
weird angles :).</p>

I had firewall, motor, &quot;side conduit&quot;, and panel, as ground points - all bonded with those straps.</p>

<p>I also had some fun with ADELs right where the wires turn from the &quot;side conduit&quot; towards the panel.
I had to clear and negotiate a couple bowdens, and the engine monitor harness was unwieldy.</p>
<p>I think that took a number of hours, just trying various setups, the final one that I really liked was this:</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Engine monitor and carb heat bowden.</p><p>I replaced all the ugly zipties with lacing, of course :).</p>
<p>Meanwhile, on the outside, to keep the wires nicely separated, I spread them out in kind of a &quot;fan&quot; in the order
they ran, back to front:</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Wire fan</p><p>A day later, I replaced the tape with a comb. Yep, a cheapo $1 comb :) Worked out great.</p>
<p>And finally, before committing and continuing, I checked each wire for gauge, and proper circuitry.</p>

<h2>Side Contuit, Part I</h2>
<p>With all those wires sticking out, it was now time to start figuring out routing in the side conduit. All the wires
that had to go forward had, well, to go forward.</p>
<p>After lots of fiddling, I ended up with this:</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Initial stab at the side conduit routing</p><p>I had to clear all the brackets, and other sharp things. Ended up adding a couple more ADELs (and drilling holes

</div>
<div class="section" id="front-panel">
<h2>Front Panel</h2>
<p>The most interesting piece in it was a Westach tach, that fed directly off of a P-Lead and required a .25A
fuse. Glenn used a 1A classic glass fuse, but I decided to do it right. See, the thing is, if it fails &quot;short
circuit&quot;, that'd turn off the mag - I guess that's why the fuse is in there.</p>
<p>The tach would get another 20GA shielded wire, just like a p-lead, and I decided to join it to right mag's
p-lead at the magneto - instead of splicing it into the p-lead running front to back in the side conduit.</p>
<p>But, back to the fuse. I figured, I'd build it into my connector that hooks up to the tach. Then, if blown,
the connector could be rebuilt. Yep, it's more annoying than a regular replaceable fuse, but that circuit is
not critical, and I had no room for a &quot;regular&quot; fuse block or holder.</p>
<p>So I got me a &quot;legged&quot; .25A fuse with a massive voltage rating (I forget what it was, but definitely above
what a mag makes), and hooked it to a regular Molex pin.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">On the tach</p><p>The lead is just a regular pigtailed P-lead, of course. Notice how I like using SCL around individual Molex pins
for added strain relief - that's because I can't produce good Molex crimps that I like; and I end up post-soldering
them in addition to crimping. That strain relief ensures that soldered joint is firmly held immobile. Takes a bit
of extra time, but I actually like that better than straight Molex crimps.</p>
<p>The rest of the front panel wasn't interesting, just annoying. There's only three circuits there: nav lights wires
from the left wing run along the back of the panel to the right side where the conduit is, and then there's hobbs
and tach, and that's it. It was just very annoying: with very little access, not being able to see things,
and, being in the front hole, having to climb out and in every time I needed a tool I forgot to put close (when
in the back hole, I can roll up a cart to it and have all my tools there).</p>
<p>Mirror was absolutely required.</p>

<h2>Firewall Forward</h2>
<p>The final set of wires to join the main harness were all the wires coming from the firewall side - mainly,
transducers and other instrumentation wires, but also a couple wires for the voltage regulator.</p>
<p>This was precisely when I realized the mistake I talked about in the beginning - and ended up with less
neat, and more tortured harness. Oh well.</p>
<p>I started up front, trimming and terminating my fat wires for the starter and alternator B-feed. Some more extreme
soldering (to cap them), this time with a torch.</p>

tail light is hooked up to the rudder with a pair of screws thru sheet metal of the rear rudder bow... I don't even want to begin to think what
the ground path would be: hinges? control cables?</p>
<p>So, I needed a second wire.</p>
<p>Problem number two: it had to be one neat cable, and it had to be of a smallish diameter (Remo had an old 20GA wire, which is thicker
than modern 20GA tefzel wire).</p>
<p>I decided to use a chunk of  20GA shielded - same ones I used for p-leads. Technically I guess you're not supposed to do that, but it's
very far from all the antennas and I'm crossing my fingers that it won't create too much problems. Thickness was spot on.</p>
<p>So, I soldered the new piece to the old wire, and fished it thru using old wire as a pull. That part was scary - if that didn't
work, I would've had to cut holes in the rudder to get a new wire thru.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">All hooked up!</p><p>On the other end (on the tail fin side) the wire went into a hole on the inspection cover, and had to join the wire coming from the front.
And I had to have the ground there. You can see that area right behind the elevator on the &quot;fishing wire thru&quot; picture.</p>
<p>Problem number three: <em>nothing</em> to hook up the ground to in that area. The only option I figured out  was to use one of the rivnuts that are
attached to the tabs welded to the frame, hoping that there's no corrosion there between the aluminum rivnut and steel fuselage. I figured I'd
use a way too long a screw thru one of the rivnuts when attaching that inspection cover, and then pull the ring terminal onto it, and secure it
against the back side of the rivnut with a nut and a washer. Ugly? Yes; but I didn't have any more options. Really, the right way to do that
would be to run two wires from the pilot panel all the way back, but.. I'd have to start cutting fabric for that.</p>
<p>So, I attached the positive to the wire that was already there, terminated my ground, hooked everything up, hooked up some power, and...</p>
<p>Nothing.</p>
<p>A bit of debugging showed that... ground was the problem. Damn! I picked the wrong rivnut, I guess - it had corrosion.
The one right on the other side though showed the right voltage when measured against the positive lead, so I just moved everything to the
other side, and...</p>

<p>First, conduit, cockpit side. Lots of crossing things, lots of padding for bowdens where they cross the wires (I used the right
sized vinyl tubing from my local friendly Aerospace Depot, and lacing to tie it).</p>
<p>Engine monitor harness got covered in tube for quite a distance - there was no way to keep it off and not rubbing on the conduit.</p>

money on shipping small-headed #10 screws (the screws in the terminals are #8 but with small &quot;oval&quot; rather than &quot;pan&quot; aviation style head,
so I'd have to get me some decent screws from McMaster.. by the time I'd be done, it'd be close to those $35).</p>

<hr class="dashed"/><p>This was a small project to wrap up everything I could do firewall forward before moving on to the panel and main wiring.</p>
<p>I wanted to clean up the engine monitor probes harness. When Glenn installed it, he used zipties everywhere (and actually
everything on the plane was ziptied). Nothing wrong with that, except where zipties were used around motor mount and the like
without any cushioning.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2020-05-01-probes/p-1.jpg" title="Probe wires with zipties" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2020-05-01-probes/p-1-thumb.jpg" title="Probe wires with zipties" alt="Probe wires with zipties" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Probe wires with zipties</p><p>But last I checked, zipties weren't used in the 1930s. No, in the 1930s grass was greener, trees taller, water wetter,
and Real Men used wire lacing to tie their wiring harnesses together.</p>
<p>And using adel clamps on round tube is just good karma.</p>
<p>So, I re-did one side first.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2020-05-01-probes/p-2.jpg" title="Properly laced and mounted" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2020-05-01-probes/p-2-thumb.jpg" title="Properly laced and mounted" alt="Properly laced and mounted" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Properly laced and mounted</p><p>Much better isn't it? Those wing nuts are temporary - I will replace them all with real ones when finishing up FWF much later.</p>
<p>I did the other side, though didn't tie it up yet - there will be more wires joining that branch later, and I had to wait until
they were done. But, I did set up all the adel clamps - about 4 pairs of them total.</p>
<p>Next, came the carb temp probe. I had to extend it's wire, and hook it back into the main harness. I repositioned it a long time
ago because I ditched the Rotec TBI, and the old wire was just a touch too short.</p>
<p>I spent quite a bit of time making sure that it's a thermocouple, and that I can reliably extend it - with same material and type
thermocouple wire. I did some basic tests with extending it and making sure it shows reasonable numbers. It did.</p>
<p>I thought a couple times about ditching it; but decided to keep it if I could, and my tests showed that I could do that.</p>
<p>Mounting and routing ended up looking something like this:</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2020-05-01-probes/p-3.jpg" title="Carb temp probe wire" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2020-05-01-probes/p-3-thumb.jpg" title="Carb temp probe wire" alt="Carb temp probe wire" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Carb temp probe wire</p><p>From there, it'd go straight to the motor mount (towards the firewall), and join the engine monitor harness.</p>
<p>When extending the thermocouple, the easiest thing to do is make sure that the joining thermocouple wires mesh together - this
way, you're not introducing a section of a dissimilar metal between two segments.</p>
<p>To do that, I used simple Molex &quot;barrel&quot; butt splices that allow you to put one wire on top of another and crimp around. You
then heatshrink the joint. In fact, I'm starting to like them, and am thinking about using them instead of the usual AMP butt
splices with nylon insulation. They are much cleaner and compact, and heatshrink I use here (SCL) provides ample
strain relief (it shrinks to hard plastic, and glues itself to the wire).</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Extension being put on</p><p>I shrunk each crimp individually, and then another chunk around the whole thing. The whole thing was set up to be held by a
second clamp (you'll see it in the picture a bit further down).</p>
<p>Back when I <a class="reference external" href="http://79ft.net/entries/cgr-30/">installed the CGR-30</a> on the Cheetah, I encapsulated all the
probe wires into fiberglass sleeve, and here it'd fit perfect - to support the lonely wire spanning about a foot to the motor mount.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Fiberglass sleeve</p><p>I also used CGR's &quot;barrel connectors&quot; to hook up to the harness end. They have the wires &quot;mesh&quot; together, and fix them with a
grubscrew, making the whole thing removable. Not sure when I'd want to do that, but I wanted to have an option.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Barrel connectors hooking up to the main lead</p><p>Before closing it up, I tested everything. The probe had to be in the carb, so the best I could figure was to check if the ambient
reading was good, and then heat it up and make sure that was reflected.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">All closed up</p><p>Turned out  pretty nice methinks - and I didn't have to lose the probe. The joint between the extension wire and the probe wire is
very close to the adel clamp holding the fiberglass sleeve to the airbox, on the right side - and remember, it's in hard plastic
that the heatshrink that's under the fiberglass sleeve turned into - so I'm not concerned about the joint failing there.</p>

<h2>Fat Wires</h2>
<p>The contactors got mounted and torque sealed (of course I forgot to add a diode jumper to the starter contactor, will have
to add later). Next, came figuring out the alternator wire and battery contactor -&gt; shunt jumper (main buss feeder from the battery
basically).</p>
<p>Initially, I thought I could route the alternator wire on the right side of the motor; keeping the starter on the left (remember,
the firewall layout on this plane is reversed of sorts - with battery and oil cooler having their locations swapped and producing
all sorts of grief due to that).</p>
<p>While not bad, holding the alternator wire on the firewall would've required more holes, and it'd go straight down, at
90 degrees to the main harness on the firewall (going left to right), kinda &quot;crossing&quot; it under. So I gave that idea up pretty quick,
instead deciding to run it along that main harness - neatness and 1 less hole/clamp instead of a shorter by about a foot run.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">The initial setup</p><p>I did not like this. See how tight that Master &lt;-&gt; Starter contactor jumper is? It was very tight. The rigid alternator wire
hooked into the ring on the master contactor side was too tight too (that adel clamp that I needed to hold stuff under the
starter contactor had to be there - there will be other wires bundled there later). It was so tight that it bent the ring
when I attempted to set it up.</p>
<p>No, that wasn't good at all.... hmmm..</p>

that made the fat red wire jumper much longer, it made the whole setup much, much cleaner. It made the buss feed wire a bit less pretty,

<h2>Ground Strap</h2>
<p>This plane didn't have any. The battery was grounded to the motor (good - the biggest current demand is from the starter). The motor
wasn't grounded to anything else at all, making the current flow thru probably the control cables and fuel hoses to the rest of
the plane. Not good.</p>
<p>So, one was needed. That took more thinking and fiddling. I had a plan initially to ground the battery to the motor and the
motor mount (Grummans do something similar - battery to firewall; and motor mount to motor) - but I wasn't sure about
how good a connection there is between the motor mount and the firewall. So I decided to jump the motor to the firewall -
a very common setup.</p>

<p>Battery leads were easy to make. Had to fiddle a bit with grommets (holes in the box are much larger than wires, and I had to
use a &quot;hose section around a wire in the grommet&quot; trick to keep the wire tight and nice.</p>
<p>The battery box was another matter though.</p>
<p>Glenn had replaced the original large (&quot;standard&quot;) battery with a small Odyssey - and took out the space with a bunch of chunks
of random foam...</p>

drain - setup for an old school battery that could leak acid). Those dimples were sized for a full size battery, so Odyssey couldn't stand on them.</p>

<p>I hooked up the leads, routed them out of the box, and closed it up, only to realize that the battery was loose in the &quot;up and down&quot;

it <em>is</em> aerobatic after all!)</p>
<p>Ordered some foam from McMaster, and padded the top of the box, and the battery sides.</p>

<h2>Trying to Get off Easily</h2>
<p>After <a class="reference external" href="http://79ft.net/entries/2020-02-23-xcers-brackets/">having mounted my transducers</a>,
it was time to hook'em up.</p>
<p>I also needed a new engine pump -&gt; carb hose, because the old one was too long.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Ugly hose.</p><p>There are a few options of course. Pre-fabbed hoses - you gotta measure carefully and they'll be made to the exact sizes you want.
You can buy fittings and make your own. You can go with different styles - integrated silicone firesleeve or &quot;crimp on&quot;, rubber
or teflon, yada yada.</p>
<p>I decided to go with pre-fabbed. I did the math a number of times; and a pre-fabbed hose was cheaper than making my own.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://www.tsflightlines.com/home.html">TS Flightlines</a> has a great reputation on the Biplane Forum, and are pretty much
the go to guys.</p>
<p>So, time to measure!</p>
<p>I had to re-clock the fittings on the engine fuel pump, so I loosened the jam nuts...</p>
<p>What? .... Jam nuts backed off, and fittings won't turn easily?! They should just unscrew!</p>
<p>Fittings moved with a wrench - and I discovered .. my favorite, The White Schmoo of Death. The teflon dope.</p>
<p>For some inexplicable reason, whomever undid the plumbing last time, re-plumbed it with the sealant everywhere. Okay, NPT fittings
need sealant (though, a choice of a crumbly drying type stuff is questionable - because when it's left in a female fitting, getting
it out without it getting it's crumbs into the system is almost impossible). But o-ring boss? Where there's a straight thread fitting
with a nut and an o-ring? No sir! The o-ring seals it just fine! Siiigh.</p>
<p>Here it is. That lovely sealant.</p>

it out of the TBI. Frankly, I was glad I tossed the TBI altogether, hoping that that was the only place I'd
find that sealant... Only to.. Oh well.</p>
<p>I had to take the pump out. No way I could clean out that damn stuff out of the hole w/o getting it all inside.</p>
<p>Slowly and steadily, with the hole pointed down, I scraped and scraped and scraped it with my dental pick, followed with a brush wetted
in Goof Off that kinda softens it. It was.. hours. For two holes.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Clean.</p><p>Phew. The pump went back on, and finally, I could clock the fittings how I wanted them.</p>
<p>I used a few old hoses I had lying around, and chunks of safety wire to mock up my new ones; measured the mockups, and
made a bunch of pictures like this:</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">A drawing of a hose</p><p>Next morning, I called TS.</p>
<p>Tom, the owner, is the guy who answers the phone. A quick email with pictures, a quick conversation about various hose ends
(we ended up doing a few -3's instead of -2's as I had before), etc etc - and the order was in.</p>
<p>And, a few days later, a box showed up at my door!</p>
<p>Next time at the hangar, I tried them on. The hoses were perfect! But, something I haven't considered before...</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2020-04-29-hosed/h-21.jpg" title="Tee to engine pump" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2020-04-29-hosed/h-21-thumb.jpg" title="Tee to engine pump" alt="Tee to engine pump" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Tee to engine pump</p><p>There's a tee. Right side is connected to the gascolator. Left side - to the electrical pump. Both horizontal sides
of the tee are connected with aluminum tubing. Notice the adel on the right holding onto the flare nut. The adel on the left,
barely visible, is holding onto the <em>tube</em> - motor mount geometry isn't allowing it to grab onto the nut.</p>
<p>And the whole thing is aluminum, and the hose is creating a ton of leverage onto that tee.</p>
<p>It's not the problem with my hose. I should've realized this before I even ventured there. The old hose had the same problem, of course.</p>
<p>Aluminum has fatigue life. The motor shakes. The whole thing shakes, connected by the hose. How that tee didn't crack is...
anyone's guess. On top of that, how the tube didn't crack is even more miraculous.</p>
<p>I showed it to Deene Ogden - one of our Chapter's very experienced guys. He agreed with my hunch. His suggested fix was to attempt
to tie that hose end somehow into the firewall, so that it doesn't create that much leverage.</p>
<p>Well, easier said than done. Firewall on this thing is .035 - and not rigid at all.</p>
<p>I showed it to Tom (the TS Flightlines guy). He thought that even the fact that there's aluminum tubing between firewall
and engine mount is a bad thing - though there the relative motion is small, it still might crack a tube or a flare.</p>
<p>Top that with my general dislike towards the non-firesleeved sections of aluminum tubing firewall forward (I admit, I actually
attempted to figure out a nice way to sleeve them), and incorrectly plumbed fuel transducer (it was on the &quot;suction&quot; side -
before all the pumps - and it <em>is</em> a restriction - and a restriction on a sucking side is a potential for vapor lock) - and I,
in my usual manner, decided to, of course, rebuild the whole thing.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="disassembly">
<h2>Disassembly</h2>
<p>Well, that was easy - except for my favorite white crap everywhere. All the fittings were aluminum, and most of the fittings
weren't AN.</p>
<p>Now, similar to a conversation of which sealant to use on NPT threads (you can start a fight amongst best friends by bringing it up!),
there's a massive holy war on aluminum vs. steel FWF. I am in the steel camp.</p>
<p>And there's another, smaller holy war, about using &quot;racing&quot; fittings. Folks that do say &quot;if it's good for NASCAR, it's good
enough for us&quot;. I don't know. I don't buy that. First of, those fittings are of extremely varying quality (AN level all the way
down to cheap Chinesium). Second, race cars are rebuilt all the time - and in an airplane, I bet some of those are 40 years old. Or 20.
You get the idea.</p>
<p>So I am firmly in the &quot;AN, steel&quot; camp. Even though they are $20 a pop.</p>
<p>Transducer was the hardest to clean out, because I needed to make sure none of that white crud went into it. My friend and hangar neighbor Dick G. suggested running a tap with flutes filled with grease to pick up the crud... hmm... I didn't have the right size
tap, and that sounded a bit too extreme.. but the idea..</p>

<h2>The Plan, and the Mockups</h2>
<p>So since we're redoing the whole thing; first thing I was gonna do is dump the parallel plumbing of the pumps. I guess,
Remo's idea was that in case the electric pump fails in a mode where it blocks the flow of fuel thru it, the gas
will still be able to go thru the &quot;alternative&quot; branch and still reach the mechanical pump.</p>
<p>Not sure about that. I am very used to Grummans, which are plumbed in series (electrical -&gt; engine pump -&gt; carb),
and I have not heard of a single failure there. I have heard of this type failure on an RV, which used a solid state
Facet pump that Facet tells you not to use on airplanes.</p>
<p>Okay, actually, this whole Facet pump situation is interesting, apparently. Bendix used to make these electrical pumps, but
then Facet bought that part of their business. Nowadays, they explicitly tell you not to use their pumps on airplanes!</p>
<p>But, Dave Fletcher of <a class="reference external" href="http://fletchair.com">Fletchair</a> fame buys batches of particular Facet models, and runs tests on them. He
sells off the ones that don't pass (apparently, flow rates vary wildly), and tags the ones that pass. He then sells them to Grumman
folk.</p>
<p>Hey, good enough for Grumman - good enough for me! I can have my much simpler series system (less hoses, less connections, less
fittings, less space), and trust the pump. And they're cheap! (Well, relatively speaking).</p>
<p>So, I got a pump from Fletch and bolted it on.</p>
<p>Transducer was the next big ticket item. It had to go between the engine driven pump, and the carb - the &quot;last step&quot; in the chain.</p>
<p>I needed something to mock things up. I needed hose ends.</p>
<p>... now, what's with those racing hose ends?</p>
<p>I called Mario - a great guy who fixes my cars when I don't want to :). His thing is drag racing.</p>
<p>He knew a place.</p>
<p>Couple hours later, and with a lighter wallet, I had a bag of fittings that were close enough in size, and a chunk of hose to cut up.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">One of the first x-cer mockups</p><p>This was the first. Followed what Fletcher did on the Cheetah back when we
<a class="reference external" href="http://79ft.net/entries/cgr-30/">installed the CGR-30</a>, but on the Cheetah the hose went back towards the firewall
and did a nice 180 u-turn, and came back to the carb. Here, I had to go &quot;sideways&quot; to do this &quot;hanging&quot; style if I wanted it. It
produced a weird low spot in the loop that I didn't like.</p>
<p>Next!</p>
<p>Could I maybe still have the x-cer on the firewall, and reuse some of the holes?</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2020-04-29-hosed/h-40.jpg" title="Second mockup" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2020-04-29-hosed/h-40-thumb.jpg" title="Second mockup" alt="Second mockup" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Second mockup</p><p>Much better I thought. I ran those by Tom of TS Flightlines. He thought the second setup was better, and recommended using
one of his fancy &quot;u-turn&quot;
fittings to save on the hose length. He gave me dimensions. I realized that I suck at mocking things up, and asked him if he
would be able to send me the fitting (I would gladly pay for it). He said, of course. He could send me whatever fittings I wanted,
and just figure the cost in the end. I'd make mockups and send them to him. Heck, he'd send me the hose too - and I'd cut it to size,
and make the hoses - then send them back to him, and he'll crimp and firesleeve them.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>And he was a treasure trove of information. Basically, hand-held me all the way. And I took it, and am very grateful. This was my
first plumbing job - so I needed the help.</p>
<p>One big fear I had was running bent fittings before and after the transducer, because they can induce turbulence in the flow.
Tom said that they ran them in whichever configuration, and they work fine with the setup he was suggesting. That was a great relief
too.</p>
<p>So, I made my &quot;shopping&quot; list, and he put the fittings in the mail.</p>
<p>I got them, and ran over to the nearby auto parts place to get some hose for the mockup (I decided not to fiddle with cutting
braided teflon hose). The guy took me back, we found the right I.D. stuff. I asked for ten feet. &quot;This is fuel hose, it's expensive&quot;,
said the guy. I asked how much. &quot;Two-something a foot&quot;, was the response.</p>
<p>I almost cracked up. I then told him that the fitting I brought in to check, that one fitting, was probably twice as much as 10 feet
of that hose. We then had a very nice conversation about everything airplanes :).</p>
<p>My final mockup, with fittings from Tom, looked like this:</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">The Final Mockup</p><p>The gascolator hookup looks funny, doesn't it? It's &quot;reversed&quot; - because otherwise, I had no room for hoses at all.</p>
<p>And then, the mock hoses were sent back to Tom for final fabrication.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-gascolator">
<h2>The Gascolator</h2>
<p>Somewhere in between all the mocking up and messing around, I had to figure out what to do with the gascolator. See, it had no
mount. None.</p>
<p>It was basically &quot;hanging&quot; on the fittings coming into each side, and rigid aluminum tubing. Yeah. Ugh. But that's besides the
point - with flexible hoses, it'll be bouncing in that &quot;ring holder&quot; that isn't holding it at all, apparently.</p>
<p>I'll admit, buying a new gascolator with mounting options crossed my mind. But then.. I thought, maybe some kind of latch..</p>
<p>Something that will hook to the bottom of the ring on the gascolator, and the top of that &quot;bracket&quot; and pull it up.</p>
<p>I search McMaster and other catalogues and couldn't find anything... An idea crossed my mind.. maybe..</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Installed!</p><p>It worked! I made two more - planning to have them at 120 degrees to each other around the gascolator.</p>
<p>The diameter of the gascolator's top was a smidge undersized for the ring it was in - Glenn had some kind of a sticky foam
in there. I replaced it with proper, aircraft grade felt :).</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Felt pad</p><p>And then, the drain.</p>
<p>The quickdrain on that bowl was leaking. I found that a looong time ago, and attempted to replace it. Obviously, I had to take
the old one out....</p>
<p>... only to discover that the threads on the bowl were all chewed up.</p>
<p>No problem, thought I, and ordered a new bowl from Spruce.</p>
<p>The threads on that one.. looked even worse.</p>
<p>I contacted Spruce. No problem! They sent me a new one.....</p>
<p>... slightly better, but still chewed up!</p>
<p>Here's one of the pictures I sent to Spruce back then, just for illustration.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2020-04-29-hosed/gask.jpg" title="Bad threads" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2020-04-29-hosed/gask-thumb.jpg" title="Bad threads" alt="Bad threads" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Bad threads</p><p>They said, they will talk to the manufacturer, and have them direct ship one to me. Then, they got silent for a long time, and
then I somehow ended up with two? I think? All with bad threads.</p>
<p>All and all, I ended up with <em>five</em> bowls. That happened almost a year ago, and frankly, I don't exactly remember how exactly the
fifth happend, but I ended up with five.
And Spruce didn't want them back. And they refunded me the money.</p>
<p>But that was then. This was now. Now, I had a tap just the right size, and was set up in the hangar.</p>
<p>This is a 1/8&quot; NPT thread - so tapping it just a hair further would re-cut the bad parts and remove a bit more material, fixing
the threads.</p>
<p>So I took one of the bowls, re-tapped the hole, and started putting in the quickdrain. Ha! Not so easy. There's nothing on the bowl to
grab onto, and I had to tighten the quick drain pretty tight (1 1/2 to 2 turns past hand tight).</p>
<p>I kinda tried to use my vise to help me - holding onto the round thing isn't easy but I tried, using my hand too... Clack! The wrench
slipped, and the bowl went bouncing on the floor.</p>
<p>A bit of damage surveillance showed a nick on the lip where it contacts the rubber seal on the gascolator top, and my better part decided
that I need to be punished and re-do it. Heck, I had FIVE bowls!</p>
<p>So, I tapped the second one. The quick drain went in. It was annoying, but I managed. 1 1/2 turns.</p>
<p>Hmm.. Why does it look so weird... and not work?
Hmm.... Did the torque and compressing the hollow quickdrain with &quot;wedge&quot; action of NPT thread mess it up? Evidently.</p>
<p>But I turned it 1 1/2 turns!!</p>
<p>Idiot me, of course. The 1 1/2 turns is probably too much to begin with (though Vans recommends it in their manual). And besides, they
talk about AN plumbing fittings. Not special fittings like this quick drain.</p>
<p>I googled &quot;Curtiss Quick Drain Torque&quot;... Sure enough. Tiny. 40 inch pounds if I remember correctly. Way to be an idiot, dude.</p>
<p>But I have three more bowls to mess up!</p>
<p>Okay, bowl number three.... tap... attempt to hold... slip.. fall... DING! Damn.</p>
<p>This is stupid, I know. I had to stop and figure out a fixture to hold the bowl while torquing the fitting after the first one
slipped out of the vice (try holding a round object in a vice w/o a fixture?! Idiot). This was the ... &quot;try to get away with it&quot; mode.</p>
<p>Enough. See, I was in such a weird state of mind I didn't take any pictures?</p>
<p>And the solution was simple and right there, of course.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Hoses!</p><p>The hoses showed up, and I already had the fittings arrived earlier from Spruce.</p>
<p>I messed with the transducer a ton. That was another hard part to hold - and I'll admit to bending it's outside box
(that's non-sequitir but annoying). This transducer is weird - it has it's body and it's brains all in a very thin sheet stainless
&quot;box&quot;, making it virtually impossible to hold onto and screw the fitting in. But the bend in that body doesn't affect anything - it's
like a &quot;cover&quot;.</p>
<p>I'll admit to thinking I overtorqued the transducer fittings, too - and removing them to check for cracks (only to find that no,
I actually didn't overtorque them - the manufacturer's spec was higher).</p>
<p>But in the end, it all worked out for the initial hookup. I'll have to tighten everything and clean up the angles on the fittings
a bit when getting closer to the engine start; but the initial fit up worked great. Tom did a great job!</p>

<p>So, right to it, shall we?</p>
<p>First things first was to get thru the firewall. I had these fancy penetration trims for cables called 'CableSafe' from Spruce</p>

<p>Hooked the clevis ends to the control cables, and the cables to the carb to verify everything.</p>
<p>When measuring, I figured I'd need a rod end for the mixture arm due to misalignment of the cable rod and the control arm. And
the damn bushing, too - because the hole in the carb is 1/4&quot;, and the bolt is #10. I got some bushing stock from McMaster, but
it was too long - had to shorten it with some creative sanding.</p>

<p>Upon closer examination, I realized that the airbox was welded together way off, and is crooked itself. And the filter is mounted
even more crooked in the same clockwise direction.</p>
<p>To confirm, searched all the pics I could find online of the plane prior to my having it (and disassembling the front).</p>
<p>It was hard to tell, but.. I think it was like this from the very beginning.</p>
<p>Phew.</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>Meanwhile, we had a night of a kind of weather when it rains without actually raining - you know, as if you are in a cloud with
large droplets. Everything in the hangar got soaked, obviously. Including my clevis ends.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Rust on a new rod end?!</p><p>Aren't they supposed to be cad plated? Oh; and that was the first time I really noticed how cad plating sacrifices itself to prevent
rust on steel - a lot of my hardware was covered in little white stains, which were cadmium having corroded and saved steel.</p>
<p>At any rate, I double checked the order paperwork. &quot;Cad plated&quot;. Hmmmm. They definitely were <em>not</em>.</p>
<p>Called Spruce. She checked and doublechecked - and confirmed that indeed, their vendor stopped doing cad plated clevis forks specifically in that dimension - #10 end, #10 rod. They refunded my money, and let me keep the forks.</p>
<p>Called SkyGeek, asking about the clevis forks they sell. The lady goes, &quot;yep, plated&quot;. I ask her to triple-confirm.</p>
<p>She takes about 10 minutes, and gets back to me - nope, not plated. She's sorry. No longer made.</p>
<p>John F., a local IA, confirmed. Only plain steel now, seems that cad plated forks are unobtanium. Crap! Oh well, I guess, paying
attention and making sure to put oil or something similar on them from time to time is in my future.</p>

<p>Glenn had a carb temp probe in the Rotec TBI I am replacing, and I decided to try to keep it. Wire was cut way too short for how
everything's on the carb (vs. the TBI), so I spent a bit of time pondering if:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The probe was a thermistor, or a thermocouple</li>
<li>If latter, could I successfully extend it</li>
</ul>
<p>Pouring thru (mostly AeroLectric Bob Nuckoll's) notes on thermocouples, realized that some are magnetic. Let's see.. score!
Magnetic indeed.</p>
<p>Got some multi-strand thermocouple wire of the same kind (red/yellow - I forget which metals those are :) ), and did some &quot;back-bench&quot;
testing.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Hook up the probe direct to the gauge</li>
<li>Pour solvent onto the probe tip, watch for rate of temp change and lowest point</li>
<li>Extend the wire now, do the pour again</li>
<li>Subjectively decide if the indications were &quot;roughly matching&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>They seemed to have been indeed matching, so I decided to attempt to keep the probe.</p>
<p>But, problem. It'd interfere with the airbox'es mounting bracket (and for some reason, I didn't take a picture of that :( ).</p>
<p>So first, let's cut a slot that will let that bracket clear the wire.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2020-02-21-carb-finished/c-13.jpg" title="Slot" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2020-02-21-carb-finished/c-13-thumb.jpg" title="Slot" alt="Slot" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Slot</p><p>A bit of drilling, a bit of hacksawing, and a bit of filing.</p>
<p>Then,</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2020-02-21-carb-finished/c-15.jpg" title="Trial fit" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2020-02-21-carb-finished/c-15-thumb.jpg" title="Trial fit" alt="Trial fit" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Trial fit</p><p>Nope, still not good. The carb temp probe there is the little thing that looks like a bolt with a wire sticking out of it -
and it's hex was interfering a bit. But we cleared the wire now.</p>
<p>So, a touch more cutting was in order.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2020-02-21-carb-finished/c-18.jpg" title="A touch more cutting" >

 </a> <p class="small text-center">A touch more cutting</p><p>... and it fit.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Since I was messing with the airbox, needed to finish one last thing on it.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2020-02-21-carb-finished/c-19.jpg" title="Carb heat bowden bracket" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2020-02-21-carb-finished/c-19-thumb.jpg" title="Carb heat bowden bracket" alt="Carb heat bowden bracket" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Carb heat bowden bracket</p><p>That bracket holds the carb heat bowden cable. Notice something weird? Yep, castellated <em>shear nuts</em> and <em>pins</em>. And, no, they weren't
tight either, so the whole bracket business was wobbling around.</p>
<p>I spent quite some time pondering why would it be set up like that. Castellated, pin, not tight, wobble - all of that adds up to
&quot;he wanted that bracket to move around&quot;. It adds up really well too! The setup makes total sense if he wanted to have this
arm move around - but there is absolutely no reason for it to do that! In fact, it's not good at all - steel bracket with steel bolts
moving around holes drilled thru aluminum airbox - that would elongate and tear up those holes!</p>
<p>I decided that no. It should not move around, in fact. So,</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Hardware replaced</p><p>--</p>
<p>And then, the final hookups of everything after a long break. Routed the cables, and hooked them up with adel clamps where necessary
(doing that conforms them to their final shape, which causes some changes in positions of the cable and controls and the range of
motion).</p>
<p>Then, fine-tuned positioning of the controls, and tightened the pivot bolt on the bellcranks. Clevis pins might still need to come out
- and that's why cotter pins aren't bent yet - just in case I'll need to unhook them again.</p>

with much more of the FireBarrier to put a good layer of it around this and other firewall penetrations.</p>
<p>And then, and then... Oh yeah! I could torque the throttle arm nut, and pin that in place!</p>

<hr class="dashed"/><p>I was on the fence about making this entry as multiple separate ones versus just one giant one... After all, it covers
quite a few, mostly unrelated, things that I did in the last few days, and it would've made sense to keep
them separate.</p>
<p>However; finally decided to make just one big article with all of them. None of them are finished; but somewhat a decent
chunk of work is - I think I have <em>mostly</em> figured out where everything will go and how it will all come together.</p>
<p>I guess, what I'm trying to say is, if you clicked on the &quot;Panel Layout&quot; entry in the Log, and are trying to figure out why
are you seeing notes on Firewall Forward, just keep scrolling :).</p>
<div class="section" id="diagram">
<h2>Diagram</h2>
<p>I have updated the electrical diagram, version 2 is <a class="reference external" href="/files/6781G-new-electrical/6781G-wiring-diagram.v2.pdf">here</a>.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Main Connector is gone. I was convinced that reliability concerns outweigh the benefits of having it. Plus, I have very
little precious room to work with.</li>
<li>Physically, it's easier to hook up the LR3C Sense wire to a different spot - on the Shunt stud rather than to the
Master Contactor/Starter Contactor jumper directly. It makes no difference, it's the same circuit - just a different hookup spot to it.</li>
<li>I also fixed some typos, and cleaned up a bit.</li>

<h2>Firewall Forward</h2>
<p>I started trying things around firewall forward while
<a class="reference external" href="http://79ft.net/entries/2019-09-01-carb-cables/">figuring out routing and lengths for carb control cables</a>, and continued
afterwards.</p>
<div class="section" id="contactors-and-beefy-wires">
<h3>Contactors and Beefy Wires</h3>
<div class="section" id="contactors">
<h4>Contactors</h4>
<p>It became obvious fairly quickly that I won't be able to use the nice B&amp;C Starter Contactor because of it's mounting
holes not being the same as a very common SS581 Starter Solenoid that was set up by Remo. Also, the way terminals
were set up on the B&amp;C Starter Contactor would have made them closer to the carb control cables. And, I didn't want to drill more
holes in the firewall.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">SS581 Contactor</p><p>So I decided to go with SS581-style and ordered one from Vans. While waiting for it, I used the old one just to mock
things up.</p>
<p>And because it doesn't have the spike catcher diode, I had to get me a couple IN5400s, and soldered an extension lead to one
of them.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Extension lead</p><p>The other leg will get a crimp ring terminal. I had to do that 'cause the diode leads themselves weren't long enough.</p>

<div class="section" id="battery-and-starter-wires">
<h4>Battery and Starter Wires</h4>
<p>Those are the thickest wires, and routing them is more complicated than the other ones. In addition, the
battery + -&gt; master contactor wire is the only wire that can't be turned off, and therefore needs to be very well
thought out and as short as possible.</p>
<p>Here's something else, too. The Charger was set up to ground the battery to the motor. So far, so good - starter is by far
the largest consumer in the electrical system. However, nothing was done to ground the motor to the rest of the airplane!</p>
<p>So the rest of the system was probably grounded via whatever metal to metal connections there were on the motor.
Control cables and braided fuel and oil hoses? ;) Airbox bowden &quot;carb heat&quot; cable... I can't think of much more else.</p>
<p>Initially, I was planning to run a ground strap braid from the battery negative to one of the bolts holding the battery
box to the firewall, but with fuel system components and control cables around, just couldn't figure out a good way to run
it and support it. I had to end up settling for running it to the engine mount instead.</p>
<p>So the bottom line is, the negative 4GA cable is gonna go to the motor, and parallel to it a braid will go to the motor mount.
I also figured out a clamp arrangement with some standoffs that will keep the wires neat and organized.</p>

The Oil Cooler box on this plane is all sorts of weird, including a flapper valve controlled by one of those bowdens that closes up the airflow to it (which is not enough to begin with; being a 1.5&quot; SCAT takeoff off of back baffle.. but don't get me started on that). That cable turned out to be too short when
relocated - but I lucked out - Glenn had a bowden going to the Rotec TBI that I removed for &quot;prime&quot; function, and that bowden was plenty
long. I'll trim it to final length when I'm done in that side conduit.</p>
<p>The brake tube was running inside the conduit, and I will have to relocate it to run below the conduit and be supported

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Blue Sea Systems fuse block</p><p>Much better! Plus, they use ring terminals rather than tabs - and while tabs are light and simple, I don't like them.
Removing them is hard, and, when removed, the terminal loses a lot of it's grip. It's almost like an &quot;assemble once&quot; type
deal.</p>

<h3>Voltage Regulator</h3>
<p>With how the wire harness is gonna go in that conduit, and with bowdens being where they are, the best orientation for the
Voltage Regulator would've been &quot;upside down&quot;, with terminal strip up.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Upside Down orientation</p><p>Damn you, the yellow sticker on the regulator! DAMN you! (hint: read it :) ).</p>
<p>Mounting it sideways, I'd have a line of rivet heads under it - which I didn't want to deal with.</p>

complicate wiring.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Down orientation</p><p>Upside down would've been perfect... except for that yellow sticker :). So, I decided to Hail Mary and asked nice folks at
B&amp;C about what they thought.</p>
<p>See, the problem is I know why they wanted the terminal strip to be pointed down. It's so that water won't get into the
box in case of condensation accumulating on it. But I thought, maybe I can seal it somehow?</p>
<p>The answer from TJ at B&amp;C was a resounding no. Right side up, sideways - but not upside down.</p>
<p>So I mocked up the right side up mounting...</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-09-08-fwf-side-channel-panel-layouts/cond-12.jpg" title="Right side up mockup" >

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Right side up mockup</p><p>Yuck. Yeah; it'd work; but it's ugly as hell.</p>
<p>The only other option would be sideways, but on &quot;standoffs&quot; of sorts to clear the rivet heads. I mentioned that to TJ, and he
said that that could work, but I should check if I can access the voltage adjustment screw on the top of the box.</p>
<p>Damn it! I forgot about it. On the top of the box there's a plug over a hole that opens up access to a tiny screw to adjust
buss voltage - basically, to fine tune how much volts the battery sees. Not something you do often, but you want to be able
to do it.</p>
<p>But then, TJ mentioned that he saw the holes in the firewall and that might be the saving grace.</p>
<p>Bingo!</p>
<p>I tried it out again in vertical, now with mocked up standoffs</p>

in the firewall (this hole was left over from the brake line relocation), pop the plug on the voltage regulator, and
just have enough access to the adjustment screw.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Unsightly hole</p><p>... and I thought, maybe I could put the Hobbs back there?</p>
<p>My initial tests with one of the  2 1/4 gauges I have removed seemed to have been okay: there was <em>just enough</em> room
in there to get another 2 1/4 gauge in.</p>
<p>So, I got me a very nice panel punch that could make a nice, round, clean hole in place.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Instrument Hole Punch</p><p>Well, next was to remove the Hobbs from the front panel. <em>That</em> was an hour of contortionism. The Hobbs is
held by an aluminum backplate and
four nylock nuts, so I <em>had</em> to have a wrench over them the <em>whole</em> time. Oh, the screws are way too long BTW, so taking all
them out took about five times more turns than it should've, while I was wondering if my wrists will take this much
flexing, twisting, and bending any longer.</p>

hold with your fingers. On the Hobbs, it was nylocks.</p>
<p>Anyway, I got it out.  And then, started setting up for punching that hole.
Removed VSI to give me a bit more room to work with.</p>
<p>I tried to reconstruct exactly what happened next in my memory to write it down here, and could not.
I was basically fiddling, checking clearances, making sure I'll be able to hook up the punch and center the hole, have
enough room for the mounting ring in the back and clear everything I had to clear, when I discovered that...</p>
<p>The Hobbs was <em>not</em> a standard 2 1/4 inch gauge - it was a touch <em>bigger</em>. So the hole that I would've made would've been
too small for it. And that if I punched the hole, I would've been just left with a bigger hole and nothing to
put in there.</p>
<p>Damn, damn, damn! Damn you, assumptions that every &quot;small&quot; gauge on an airplane is 2 1/4!</p>
<p>And I had the expensive punch that I had no use for :(.</p>
<p>Oh well. Thanks God I actually did <em>not</em> do it - only to have a <em>larger</em> hole to plug up. I guess, that Hobbs is (thru
more contortionism) going back to the front panel.</p>

<hr class="dashed"/><p>Even before Oshkosh, I have decided to replace the Rotec TBI the Charger had when I got it with a good old MA4-SPA carb. In short,
I do not trust the damn thing - especially with it being the sole component providing two out of three vertices
of the proverbial fire triangle to the motor. That reminds me, I need to summarize my thoughts on Rotec...</p>
<p>Regardless, one of the things  I got at Oshkosh was a rebuilt MA4-SPA from Spruce, and it was sitting in the
hangar waiting it's turn. I knew I would need to order new control cables for it, so I decided to get that going, after
all the alternator business was finished, because getting those cables will take me a bit.</p>
<p><em>Here's a fun aside. I knew this motor had a MA4 carb and Glenn &quot;upgraded&quot; it to the Rotec TBI. What I didn't
know was precisely what kind of MA4-SPA it had (and there are quite a few models of that carb).</em></p>
<p><em>No problem. At Oshkosh, I went to nice folks from Tempest (which now owns MA Carbs) and had a very nice conversation with them.
I asked if I should buy the carb from them, and they recommended Spruce instead, because it would be cheaper that way.
And, they mentioned the $600 core charge (I'll spell this out - you must provide a good &quot;core&quot; (old carburetor) or get
charged extra six hundred bucks). Ouch.</em></p>
<p><em>Ha! thought I. I am at Oshkosh! What could be easier than getting an old carburetor, especially since it's one of the
most widespread models? No problem at all!</em></p>
<p><em>Laughing, I ran that by guys from Tempest. They laughed with me, and actually were very very very helpful, telling me
what to look for when picking up an old carb.</em></p>
<p><em>No cracks in the body. Control arms should be present. Threads nice and not torn up. Venturi present. Etc etc etc.</em></p>
<p><em>Well, to the FlyMart we went, and sure enough, on a bench there laid a number of MA4-SPAs present, ranging from
$250 to $450. Of course, I picked up the $250 one (it was yellowtagged by the way! In 1995, if I recall), dragged it
over to Spruce, ordered a new carb, and handed them the old one I just picked up. So, $350 saved in about half a mile
of walking. Not bad!</em></p>
<p>Here it is, in all it's glory, hooked up to my motor. You guys should admire my &quot;economizer design&quot; gasket. Hmm... I need to patent that and start selling them for $100/pop. <em>Your fuel costs will go to 0! Now, you might not be going too far... but..
Fuel costs! Zero! With all the benefits, not going anywhere is such an insig....</em> Ahem.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Carb</p><p>Well, okay. The carb was on, and cables came next.</p>
<p>The Rotec had it's control cables for mixture and throttle done completely differently than the carb. Glenn reused Throttle
cable for Mixture on the TBI - it worked out well. He added a new cable, routed completely differently, for the TBI's
Throttle.</p>
<p>Since this motor was originally carbureted, all I had to do is reverse engineer a bit the way Remo did the hookups.</p>
<p>Hehe.</p>
<p>Well, Throttle on the carb side wasn't that bad.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">With a Clevis</p><p>It actually worked out a bit better with a Clevis, having the cable end centered nicely on the throttle arm. So I
decided to do the clevis.</p>
<p>Next was confirming the &quot;throw&quot; - making sure that the throttle control range of motion, whatever it is, is sufficient
(in fact, it must have some extra &quot;padding&quot; in it) to move the throttle stop to stop. Boy, was I in for a treat.</p>
<p>This Charger has <em>reversing</em> throttle quadrants, meaning that when the throttle goes forward,
the actual control is pulled  backward. Since forward on the control must translate into forward on the carburetor, the
Charger has bellcranks to reverse the motion once again. These bellcranks are also a nice spot to tune out the <em>range</em>
of motion.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-09-01-carb-cables/c-3.jpg" title="Control linkage" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-09-01-carb-cables/c-3-thumb.jpg" title="Control linkage" alt="Control linkage" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Control linkage</p><p>See, the relative distance of the top and bottom holes on the bellcrank to it's pivot point &quot;convert&quot; whatever range
of motion is on the control (throttle quadrant) side to an appropriate range of motion on the carburetor side.</p>
<p>And Glenn changed them.</p>
<p>Not a surprise. The Rotec TBI had it's controls set up very differently as compared to a carb. Notice how in the picture
the color of those bellcranks is somewhat off from the rest of the fuselage? That was my first clue...</p>
<p>My second clue was finding one of those bellcrank plates (minus the bearing) in the box of parts that I got with the airplane.</p>
<p>My third clue was me not being able to get the full range on the throttle.</p>
<p>Crap!</p>
<p>I am absolutely not set up to redo the bellcranks. Though they look simple, unless I want to make them from 3/16&quot; steel, which
would make them very, very, VERY heavy, I'd need a TIG welder. Or to MacGyver things with washers. And do quite a lot of
trial and error.</p>
<p>I wanted to see if I could luck out.</p>
<p>Credit goes to Glenn here - he made his new bellcranks <em>perfect</em> for the TBI. The range of motion on them was just right...
for the TBI. Because of that, they were asymmetrical - so I thought; maybe, just <em>maybe</em>, if I was to try them in different
combinations, I would luck out...</p>
<p>And I did!</p>
<p>Now, these two paragraphs of text and one picture is me describing... about 3 or 4 hours of work - tweaking cables,
turning bellcranks, checking, rinsing, and repeating. I think I did find a combination of orientation of these that gave
me <em>acceptable</em> (but by no means perfect) ranges of motion. I think I lost about an inch on both of the controls, but
that's not so bad, after all - you want extra room in your control's range of movement to make absolutely positive
you can move the controlled thing stop to stop.</p>
<p>Okay, Mixture's next.</p>
<p>I hooked up the cable that Glenn used for throttle to the mixture control on the carb, to use as a &quot;mock up&quot;,
and kinda fished it thru.</p>

   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-09-01-carb-cables/c-1-4-thumb.jpg" title="Mixture cable hookup" alt="Mixture cable hookup" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Mixture cable hookup</p><p>I had to use a rod end here. The cable wouldn't line up with the control arm on the carb for me to be able to
use a Clevis there.... See how angled and offset that hookup is? I think Remo had a solid bowden cable style control
there...</p>
<p>Another problem with the Mixture control is that the carb's arm has a 1/4&quot; hole.. the rod ends need a #10 screw; which
means that the hole on the carb arm is too large. No biggie though, I'll add a bushing to reduce it.</p>
<p>Yet another problem is that the bolt's head is way too close to the carb bowl, and I had to have it reversed like
that (bolt &quot;upside down&quot;).</p>
<p>There's not a lot of room on the top either. Planning to  fix this problem with using of 1/2
size shear nut, and figuring out the exact bolt length (I ordered every bolt between -4 and -10 sizes).</p>
<p>And now, the routing of those cables.</p>
<p>The throttle cable routing was a given. I did not like too tight a radius in one of it's &quot;turns&quot;.</p>
<p>I wanted to try to optimize the routing..... ha. Good luck there buddy! The battery box gets in the way (the battery is
in a completely wrong place on this plane... it's reversed with the oil cooler. Oil cooler should be on the left. Battery
on the right. This makes controls routing a breeze. But no.....).</p>
<p>I wanted to make sure to keep the mixture cable to not be too close to the beefy 4 AWG cable that will go from
the battery to the master relay.</p>
<p>I had to reverse engineer previous routing of the cable, and figure out the best points to hook it up to the firewall.</p>
<p>I wanted to have my ANL fuse bases close to the master and starter relay. Ha! No way, with the control cables
the way they would have to be.</p>
<p>All this was an exercise in misery, and lots and lots of time. I wanted too much.</p>
<p>In the end, the routing of the throttle will stay the same; the cable will just be shortened to make one of the
turn radiusii bigger. The mixture will go nearby, and curl around the battery box.</p>
<p>I will not be able to use any other arrangement of solenoids and will have to stick to the old one. What's worse,
I will not be able to use the new solenoid I got from B&amp;C - it's mounting holes are very different, and, frankly,
it's not worth it to drill more holes in already a sieve-like firewall - I'll stick with the classic &quot;style&quot;.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Approx. new routing</p><p>The mixture cable does look like it'll interfere with the solenoids, I know. In the final setup, it will be pulled
away from the firewall and clamped to a couple of points I found.</p>

<p>More bad news? I long noticed a leak from the left brake bleeder valve; and decided to add a new valve to my next order from Spruce.
I thought it was a basic valve problem. Well,  went to look for it's dimensions, and found out the source of the damn
leak, actually... Looks like someone tried to fix a leak there by making a bigger leak. The fun thing was, I didn't notice
this before - the brake was too dirty...</p>

<p>But hey! I got good news too! I was checking to see if the ANL bases and the shunt will fit where the old voltage regulator
was, and they fit perfectly, in just a perfect arrangement!</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">ANL bases and the ammeter shunt</p><p>I will reuse old voltage regulator rubber shock isolation mounts (I can't take them out; and they're sufficiently strong),
and make a backplate to mount all this goodness to. Frankly, when I found this fit out, I liked it so much I bust out
laughing.</p>
<p>And hey! My engine gauges showed up ;) Ain't they pretty?</p>
