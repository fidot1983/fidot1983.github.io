<p>They were done <a class="reference external" href="http://79ft.net/entries/2019-11-23-switch-plates/">quite some time ago</a>. I center punched the holes in the panel for the #2 attach screws when test-fitting
the placards, and left them at that.</p>

<hr class="dashed"/><p>While waiting for someone else to get back to me to help me finish &lt;the thing that took last month and a half
and  is yet to be written about&gt;, I decided to work on the panel a bit.</p>
<p>Lighting strip seemed like a nice place to start.</p>
<p>It's a simple LED strip that I planned to glue right behind coaming on the underside of the eyebrow. This way, it'd be
invisible from pretty much any angle.</p>
<p>But, the wires! The wires in <em>front</em> of the panel, that have to go to the behinds.. No worries I thought, I'd make  a small
hole / slit in the top of the panel, also invisible - and fish the wires thru there.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2020-01-29-light-and-compass/lc-1.jpg" title="The Plan" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2020-01-29-light-and-compass/lc-1-thumb.jpg" title="The Plan" alt="The Plan" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">The Plan</p><p>That was the plan.</p>
<p>Reality, of course, decided to disagree.</p>
<p>The plan was to take out all the screws that went around the top of the panel, and tilt it &quot;down&quot; - so that I
could use a drill comfortably to make the little slit for the wires.</p>
<p>Couple screws came out nice.</p>
<p>I think the third one came out like...</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2020-01-29-light-and-compass/lc-2.jpg" title="?!" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2020-01-29-light-and-compass/lc-2-thumb.jpg" title="?!" alt="?!" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">?!</p><p>Did I just bust a screw? I looked into the hole. <em>Empty?!</em></p>
<p>Upon further examination, I found... glue? What? The screw head was... glued into the hole? That's a first.</p>
<p>After taking the rest of the screws out, I realized what happened.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2020-01-29-light-and-compass/lc-3.jpg" title="Backside of the panel" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2020-01-29-light-and-compass/lc-3-thumb.jpg" title="Backside of the panel" alt="Backside of the panel" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Backside of the panel</p><p>This is the back side of the panel. The panel is attached thru those little tabs and nutplates.</p>
<p>Notice the nutplates using rigid (not floating) style nuts? A slight misdrilling of the holes in the panel, and screws
won't go in at all.</p>
<p>So, there were two &quot;screws&quot; that were just heads glued in - yep - and two more that used #6 screw in a #8 nut - the TPI on those is the same, and the holes were drilled sufficiently close enough to let a #6 screw pass thru; but not a #8. Le.. Sigh.</p>
<p>To top it all off, the panel won't fold down for me to get access to where I wanted to be, and to fish it out I'd have to take
out the carb heat bowden cable that was attached to it. Too much trouble if I can avoid it (that carb heat cable would've
been a 3-4 hour affair just by itself).</p>
<p>Plan B solidified; but first the panel had to be put back.</p>
<p>I ended up putting #6 screws into all the misdrilled holes (sorry, but glueing heads into holes is.. not my thing :)); but I installed nuts on them on the back. Effectively, set up like this the nutplates don't do anything - just add weight. See
the picture above - it has the nut over that nutplate. That nut, by the way, was a pain to get in - see how close another nut is to it?</p>
<p>I think all the fiddling with the panel, screws, nuts, washers (losing a few of them and going on fishing expedition
to pull them out of the guts of the plane included, of course), and trying to get it back in right took what.. around 6 hours?</p>
<p>The plan B, now executable after the panel was back in, was to route the wire under the eyebrow, and fish it thru behind
the coaming to the &quot;top&quot; side right in the middle, where the compass was to be. It then would join the compass light
wire, and go to behind the panel land.</p>
<p>So, the strip was glued, and the wire attached to under the eyebrow with <em>HVAC duct sealing tape</em>, ahem, aircraft grade
glue backed aluminum sheeting from the local friendly Aerospace Depot.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Strip glued - looking up</p><p>That picture's taken &quot;from under, looking up&quot;. Ugly? Well, not too easy to make it pretty doing it basically blind with
an inspection mirror the only view. Like this:</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">The only way to see it</p><p>The wire was fished thru to the &quot;top side&quot;, and it was time to test.</p>

<hr class="dashed"/><p>This is all your fault, you know who!</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Way back, when working on the new layout for switches on the panel, I was thinking about how to re-label them.</p>
<p>I had a nice Brady label maker, and was thinking about just printing and sticking some tags over existing, painted, lettering,
on the switch placards.</p>
<p>One of the nights, when I was tired enough to do anything useful, I was playing with the stickers, and posted this picture
here:</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-11-23-switch-plates/p-100.jpg" title="Playing with placards" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-11-23-switch-plates/p-100-thumb.jpg" title="Playing with placards" alt="Playing with placards" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Playing with placards</p><p>The you-know-who-you-are, of course, wasn't happy (this gentleman is an actual friend of mine, not a silly voice in my head).
&quot;They will fall off&quot;, he said. &quot;Can't you do something a bit more professional&quot;? &quot;Can't you draw them up, and order them to be custom made&quot;?</p>
<p>Order?</p>
<p>Ha!</p>
<p>No. This whole exercise in airplane handling is to put yourself thru as much misery as possible. So the placards had to be
made, not ordered. I mean, I could've ordered my electrical redone too, right? :)</p>
<p>I recalled that I read somewhere on Vintage Machinery that someone figured out a neat way to restore old
data plates on old lathes and such. Looking it up, I remembered.</p>
<p>Etching!</p>
<p>The idea is basic - make a mask, transfer it to a piece of metal, soak it in acid, paint, sand - your recessed (etched) areas will
keep paint, while the elevated (masked out) areas will sand out. This way, you get metal-on-paint look, and it's nice and
pretty.</p>
<p>So, it has been decided - I will etch out my switch placards!</p>
<p>First, though, I had to figure out...</p>
<div class="section" id="the-process">
<h2>The Process</h2>
<p>Obviously, SolidWorks would be instrumental in making the actual pattern. I wanted to make the placards out of brass, so that
lettering would be yellow, and I'd paint them black, for the yellow on black final result.</p>
<p>First, the mask.</p>
<p>Searching around, it seemed that the most reasonable way to go about it would be to use Toner Transfer technique. Laser printer
toner (at least on a good subset of laser printers) is basically powdered plastic. Printer warms it up, which makes it sticky -
and toner then fuses itself to
paper. It can be re-softened (and made sticky again) by a normal household iron or a laminator. I had both - an iron, obviously;
but we also had a great &quot;office grade&quot; laminator in the office.</p>
<p>A lot of folks had success with glossy paper (glossy paper doesn't absorb melted toner, it sticks, but stays on top), but I, looking
around, found a lot of good reviews of the <a class="reference external" href="https://pcbfx.com">PCB Fab in a Box</a> system.</p>
<p>Not only the guy makes a very nice toner transfer paper which &quot;releases&quot; the toner when soaked in water (it works just like your
model decals in plastic models, you soak the paper, and the top layer comes off), he also seems to have researched and cleaned up
the process to minutia. For example, the toner itself is porous (indeed!) so he uses an extra layer of plastic to &quot;fuse&quot; the
micro-gaps between toner granulas as transferred  with another layer called &quot;TRF Foil&quot;. He also did a lot of research into
printers, toners, application techniques and such - and published a great handbook. Just for that alone, I wanted him to have my
money.</p>
<p>So, I ordered the transfer paper (the one you print your mask on), and tried the first step - transferring it to a small strip of
brass in a laminator.</p>

<p>I messed around quite a bit with density, too. Just default settings were crap, obviously. Bumping up the density to max didn't help
much. I installed a new toner cartridge, and that improved the density dramatically - while not perfect, it would've been workable,
hopefully, with the addition of the TRF foil (and, if I saw any obvious holes, I could fill them with a sharpie).</p>
<p>Okay. But the basic test worked! The pattern transferred nicely.</p>
<p>Second time, I threw together another test mask with a couple of different fonts about the size I'd want on the placards -
I was gonna transfer those to a small chunk of brass bar stock, and try etching.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Second pattern</p><p>With the help of child labor, patterns were cut out, and transferred successfully to the brass bar stock.
I then applied the green TRF foil (that stuff that fuses the pores between toner's grains) to it.</p>
<p>Side note: the process manual from <a class="reference external" href="https://pcbfx.com">PCB Fab in a Box</a> notes explicitly that Brother printers have a kind
of toner that requires much higher than usual laminator's temps to melt. I have a Brother printer, but  since I was able to do
my first transfer successfully, I kinda decided to not bother - it worked, so I must be the lucky one right? Though I admit, I did entertain an idea of a new
printer... ;)</p>
<p>On one of the evenings, I had a block of a few hours, and the weather was nice. I had all my chemicals (ferric chloride PCB
etching solution and boxes of baking soda to neutralize it afterwards), so I decided to try the actual etching process.</p>
<p>I hooked up the test plate to a piece of closed cell foam (to float it on top of acid)...</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">The setup</p><p>...and went to town.</p>
<p>The idea was to try to get the ferric chloride to about 100 degrees F to speed up the process, so I did a hot water tub (hence, the
little camp stove in my setup).</p>
<p>I'd have a large tub with hot water, and a small tub with etching solution in it, with the workpiece floating on top, hooked up to
the foam.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Etch, etch away!</p><p>It took about 40-50 minutes, I think, till I was comfortable with the depth of etching. Every 10ish minutes I'd pull the piece out,
and brush it with etchant to clear the debris that, I thought, would collect in small nooks and crannies (I saw a guy do that on
one of the videos I watched).</p>
<p>After a decent etching depth was achieved, I pulled it out, and dunked it in soda to neutralize the acid.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Neutralizing</p><p>Then, lots of rinsing, while catching water into a tub. Acid, even neutralized, will contain dissolved copper, and just dumping
it is not good. I was planning to keep the tub and let water evaporate, at which point I could just wipe off the powdery residue.</p>

   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-11-23-switch-plates/p-12-thumb.jpg" title="Etched!" alt="Etched!" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Etched!</p><p>The edges on the letters (basically, the edges of the mask) are very rough there. On these test ones, I started with a maroon
pad, but quickly went to a 120 grit non-woven deburring wheel, which cleaned it up nice (and of course, messed up the letters -
well, lesson learned, I won't use that aggressive a method on the real thing).</p>
<p>Later, when painting, I noticed that the mask was still porous, letting some acid in (I had some tiny &quot;cavities&quot; in random spots).
It looked pretty good when applied.  This would become obvious later, when I started adding color. I suspected the old drum, and decided to get a
new drum for the printer - though in hindsight, I think this is, after all, the problem of me having the Brother printer
(read on ;) ). Meanwhile, I ordered a new drum and a new cartridge.</p>
<p>And then, the paint.</p>
<p>I wanted &quot;golden&quot; letters on &quot;black&quot; background. I wanted to make the whole piece black, and then sand it on a flat surface -
everything that was masked would have the black sanded off, and the rest would keep it, achieving the effect.</p>
<p>I wanted to try a couple different &quot;make it black&quot; approaches. One would be forced oxidation with something like a gun blueing
acid, and the other would be plain paint. I had two test areas, which would allow be to try both at the same time.</p>
<p>So I blued one side....</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Sanded down</p><p>Couple notes on blueing. I tried Brownells Oxpho-Blue, and then later Birchwood Casey Brass Black. Both produce a layer of black
oxide on the brass. There are a couple of problems, though.</p>
<p>First of, the etched surface is not perfect - and those imperfections are not really hidden by oxidizing, obviously. Second,
and bigger, problem, is that that oxide is powdery, and can be rubbed off easily with even a paper towel, given enough elbow
grease. I was afraid I'd have adhesion problems with the top coat (I was gonna coat the whole thing in clear to prevent tarnishing
of letters), so I decided against it.</p>
<p>The other side I decided to put just your basic schedule of Rustoleum - primer, and flat black.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Rustoleum sanded down</p><p>I liked that side much better. However, the primer, being white, would show in between the paint and the letters, being noticeable.
I decided to find some black primer - and meanwhile, coated the whole thing in lacquer, which I decided to use as a top coat.</p>
<p>Mistake! A few weeks later, lacquer started flaking off. Yeah, I learned the &quot;no lacquer on top of  enamel&quot; rule. But it was
flaking off on plain brass too, so.. lacquer was no way to go.</p>
<p>Just typing that, in hindsight, maybe there was some acid residue after blueing... but acid was dried, and I
used acetone to clean up the blued side. But again, clear brass had lacquer coming off as well.</p>
<p>Worse part is, the enamel lifted and was coming off in pieces.</p>
<p>So instead, I did something that in hindsight I think was a mistake. I decided to look for a better paint solution,
and very quickly arrived at epoxy, specifically, <a class="reference external" href="www.klasskote.com">Klass Kote</a>. It seems to be used by a lot of RC builders
very successfully, I saw successful reports of brushing it, and talked to them, too. I was sold. Again, in hindsight... I think
this was a mistake. But, read on. :)</p>

<h2>The Actual Mask</h2>
<p>To make the actual mask for the actual plates, I used my
<a class="reference external" href="http://79ft.net/entries/2019-08-31-alternator-pivot-arm/">scan-and-draw-around-it</a> Solidworks trick. I scanned the old placards,
and sketched around them.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Sketch</p><p>I very quickly discovered that on one of them, the sides were not parallel; and the holes were all not on one line, and not
evenly spaced! :). So, I made two versions - one all nice and even, and the other just like the old placards.</p>
<p>Using a bit of cardstock, I tried each of them on to make sure the holes are okay and such...</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-11-23-switch-plates/p-20.jpg" title="Trying on the pattern" >

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Trying on the pattern</p><p>Guess which ones fit better? Yep, the crooked ones! Straightening them out made holes not line up with holes in the panel, and one
of them would interfere with some screws on the panel. Oh well.</p>
<p>Then, came quite some hours (that I didn't log to be honest) fiddling with the font and the layout. I decided to use &quot;Magneto&quot;,
the kick ass italic font out of the four I tried on my test etch.</p>

have no place in an airplane. &quot;Use standardized fonts!&quot; he said. He did have a point. If it was not me in the back hole, and
it was an emergency, readability, not style, is a prime factor. So, I had to remake them.</p>

<div class="section" id="applying-the-final-mask">
<h2>Applying the Final Mask</h2>
<p>For material, I picked up a sheet of brushed &quot;Marine-Grade&quot; 464 .032&quot; thick brass from McMaster (remember this, &quot;brushed&quot; - one
side is brushed, the other is not).</p>
<p>On the final drawing for the mask, I replaced hole outlines with little &quot;donuts&quot; - thinking that those will make nice initial
&quot;center punch&quot; marks for the holes.</p>
<p>When printing it, the toner flaked off the transfer paper immediately. &quot;Bad sheet of paper&quot;, I thought. I also
found the &quot;Improve Toner Adhesion&quot; setting, and enabled it. That made a nice print-out.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">!??!??!?!?</p><p>What?! It worked before! A bunch of thoughts went rushing thru my head - more metal? Not getting it hot enough (but it was hot!)?
Bad toner? Wait!  YES! This time I used a completely new toner cartridge and new drum unit - to make sure my pattern has as little
of those pinholes as possible (remember, I ordered a new drum and toner after my initial test etch?)</p>
<p>I went home, and compared the serial numbers on the toner I had success with with the new toner. The first few letters were
different, as well as the few digits in the tail, which made me think it was a different brew of toner, and toner problem.
So, I printed the mask again with the toner that worked before.</p>
<p>I also
started thinking that the &quot;Improve Toner Adhesion&quot; setting I used might've caused mayhem. I <em>also</em> read a bit about that setting,
and it seems that Brother recommended using it if the toner flakes off <em>and</em> if setting the paper type properly (ie, &quot;plain&quot;,
&quot;card-stock&quot;, &quot;thick&quot;, etc) does <em>not</em> help. So to prevent flaking off, I set the paper thickness to &quot;thick&quot;, removed the
&quot;Improve Toner Adhesion&quot; setting, printed it again using the toner cartridge that worked before, and went back to the office...</p>

   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-11-23-switch-plates/p-35-thumb.jpg" title="Second attempt" alt="Second attempt" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Second attempt</p><p>This time I didn't use the &quot;pouch&quot; of paper I typically wrapped around to protect the brass and help the laminator pull it thru
(the laminator I was using had a problem with feeding first 2-3 inches of brass - it wouldn't pick it up - so I used paper as the
&quot;carrier&quot;, which alleviated the problem). I thought that maybe paper was preventing some heat from being transferred well, and
got rid of it this time.</p>
<p>Same problem!</p>
<p>What the hell?</p>
<p>I took the laminator home, determined to run a bunch of tests (it was Sunday ;) ).</p>
<p>I had a couple of old masks left (I printed double the amount then, in case first try didn't work - so that would cover
the toner/drum combo that I know have worked). I printed a couple of new ones - new drum/old toner, and new drum/new toner.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-11-23-switch-plates/p-38.jpg" title="Test pieces" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-11-23-switch-plates/p-38-thumb.jpg" title="Test pieces" alt="Test pieces" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Test pieces</p><p>I also changed the settings again, for the two new prints I made.</p>
<p>As I mentioned before, when first printing the final mask (the one that didn't transfer), I had it's toner literally flake off
the paper in some spots. &quot;Hmm, I thought&quot;, and re-printed it, using the &quot;Improve Toner Adhesion&quot; setting enabled. That made the paper go thru
the printer much slower, it came out much hotter than usual, and the toner adhered well.</p>
<p>On the second try (the one that didn't transfer either), I read a bit about the &quot;Improve Toner Adhesion&quot; setting, and decided
to instead try to change the paper type to a more appropriate one - so blaming whatever &quot;Improve Toner Adhesion&quot; did for not
transferring of toner,
and blaming &quot;thick&quot; <em>not</em> being set on the first try causing toner to flake off, I set &quot;thick&quot; for paper type - which, again,
caused the same effect - slow feed, hot paper, good adhesion.</p>
<p>And then, when finally doing a systematic attempt to figure out what's wrong, I remembered that on the very first test masks
(the ones on the test piece of brass buss bar stock), I didn't tweak any paper settings at all.</p>
<p>&quot;Slow Feed&quot;, &quot;Hot&quot;, vs &quot;Fast Feed&quot;, &quot;Colder&quot;. This time, I started guessing that maybe, higher temp did something to the toner
that would then prevent it from being re-melted when fed thru the laminator. I decided to try my luck with &quot;plain&quot; paper type
(fast, cold feed), and count on my luck in the toner adhesion department.</p>
<p>I lucked out - test pieces came out fine, and, with three test masks, thru the laminator we went again.. And again... 10 times total, as before.</p>
<p>This time, things definitely changed! First of, all three transferred equally, but they transferred equally... crappy.</p>
<p>So, we knew that we were onto something with the feed/temp settings of the printer affected by the &quot;Improve Toner Adhesion&quot; and paper
thickness settings.</p>
<p>But, transfer was still crap.</p>
<p>And then, I realized one more thing.</p>
<p>I was transferring to the &quot;brushed&quot; (remember, I had a &quot;brushed&quot; brass sheet?) side of brass? Those &quot;brush marks&quot; are noticeably
deep when you drag your fingernail across them. I suspected that, effectively, whichever pieces of the mask were above the
marks, wouldn't touch any of the metal, and therefore won't stick.</p>
<p>OKay, but I can use the other side! It was cruddy, but a bit of the deburring wheel...</p>
<p>Wait. Go to the airport to polish the other side? Ugh.</p>
<p>Found a piece of steel wool we use to scrub dishes. Phew. That, under water, made the other side of brass nice and clean on
short order.</p>
<p>OK, the moment of truth. Printed the pattern again, using the new toner/drum, now, when we know that toner/drum aren't causing
my transfer problems, but rather, the temp and the feed rate of the printer are.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Transferred!</p><p>Phew. Okay. So, I guess, after all, Brother toner <em>is</em> finicky, just like the Fab-in-a-Box guys tell you, and mine is
not special. I don't know why fast feed / low temp would even keep it transferable.. but... Well, the lesson I take from this is
that I will be carefully considering the toner type when buying a new printer, when that time comes.</p>
<p>And then, the foil. I'll admit, I did a couple attempts with the foil. Yeah, and when I didn't like what happened on the first
attempt, I had to re-do the mask (toner transfer, that is) yet again!</p>
<p>My laminator has serious feed issues. The foil is very finicky, and keeping it straight requires laminator to feed nice, smooth,
even, and straight. My laminator needs to be &quot;helped&quot; sometimes with pressure pushing the plate &quot;in&quot;.</p>
<p>Oh, well. After the second attempt, I realized that I probably won't achieve ideal results on such a big piece, and instead,
used Sharpie to fix as much holes in the foil as I could find.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Final mask, and lots of Sharpie.</p><p>So, bottom line. If I want to make perfect, non-porous etches, I need to get me a good printer that will do what I need, and
a good laminator that actually feeds things nicely. Later, later :).</p>

<h2>Paint</h2>
<p>I touched on the subject a bit already.</p>
<p>I was afraid of Rustoleum now, even learning that I messed it up myself with lacquer - it peeling off the base in sheets
didn't give me confidence. Rustoleum has clear enamel; but my reasoning was that if it peeled off <em>with</em> primer, clear enamel
without primer on relatively sharp edges of lettering will just come off almost immediately, given that my hands will always be
around the switches when operating them.</p>
<p>I settled on epoxy. It made sense. Klass Kote had good reviews from RC guys, and folks reported it brushable.</p>
<p>I completely stripped my old sample with brass wire brush and acetone. Wire brush cleaned it out nicely and smoothed
some roughness still left, so I wire brushed the new plates too. It helped, and seemingly worked better than the maroon
pad! Noted.</p>
<p>And then, I set up in the kitchen.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-11-23-switch-plates/p-59.jpg" title="Set up for painting." >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-11-23-switch-plates/p-59-thumb.jpg" title="Set up for painting." alt="Set up for painting." >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Set up for painting.</p><p>Klass Kote needs to be mixed, and reacted for at least 30 minutes prior to application. My plan (approved by Klass Kote) was to
do base in black, then bake it after initial flash off for 30 minutes at about 100 degrees <em>Celsius</em>. That will cure it enough to
make it sandable, after which I'd sand down the letters, and clear coat it. I won't need to bake the clear, 'cause I'm then done
for the night, and it can take it's sweet time curing.</p>
<p>Klass Kote is really thick when mixed!</p>
<p>Trying it straight on my test coupons left horrible brush marks.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Straight Klass Kote black</p><p>I tried it on my test plate as well - just to play with the baking process.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, mixed up a new batch and wanted to try it reduced with a lot of reducer to see if that would make it flow better.</p>
<p>Nope. That left the same brush marks, but just watered down, if you will. Multiple coats just made it uglier.</p>
<p>Hmm... Meanwhile, I had a batch of clear mixed too, and tried to see how the clear would look over my test plate that was now
baked and ready to be sanded down. Maybe, the brush marks would get better / a bit more hidden with extra brush marks of clear?</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">With light</p><p>See?</p>
<p>That's horrible.</p>
<p>Frustrated, I dumped my thinned batch of black into the tray I was using for garbage, and sat down thinking. My eye fell on a
foam brush I had in the set of brushes I bought. I mindlessly picked it up, and started smudging the dumped paint around the tray.</p>
<p>It flowed! Very nicely!</p>
<p>I then remembered how much I hate brushes in general. I was never able to get anything remotely approaching good with brushes.
When I built my kitchen cabs, I used cotton pads over foam brushes and achieved very smooth, mark-less results.</p>
<p>I think, this random act might've just worked!</p>
<p>I cleaned up my other, flat, coupon (the one that wasn't baked, so the epoxy would still come off with some wiping with the reducer).</p>
<p>I was now planning to mix the final batch of black I'd reduce. I'd try it on the coupon first, and then, if I liked the results,
on the actual pieces...</p>
<p>...it went on smooth, but fish-eyed a bit. I thought that that was due to some crud on the coupon (I wasn't cleaning the coupon
too good).</p>
<p>So, I put it on the actual plates.</p>
<p>It fisheyed! A lot of eyes flowed together, but some big ones stayed. I quickly dabbed them out with the corner of the brush with
some paint on it - too late, damn it! It didn't flow out. The whole thing was also rough-ish... thinned paint was flowing around
imperfections of the etched surface, as well as my dabs were messing with it, probably. There were also areas that had visible
marks of me lifting the brush.</p>
<p>At this point, I should've stopped, dunked it into the reducer, washed the whole thing off, and called it a nite.</p>
<p>But, I was too focused on getting there.</p>
<p>I thought, I might be able to get a uniform &quot;rough&quot; look.</p>
<p>Solvent was flashing off, and paint was getting thicker.</p>
<p>More paint, but this time gently, not to rub old paint off. Then, dab-dabbidy-dab the foam in and out.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">..on both</p><p>That looked acceptable, and I decided to let it  flash off the solvent. Meanwhile, went to Walmart for more foam brushes
(I only had two in the set).</p>
<p>Got back, mixed a batch of clear and left it off to react. It was looking good, with &quot;rough look&quot;, and I was thinking I might just be able to pull it off.</p>
<p>After the paint stopped being tacky, put the whole thing into my oven.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">What's for lunch, ma?</p><p>Yep, that's my toaster, repurposed as epoxy bake oven, and calibrated at 100 degrees Celsius :).</p>
<p>I forgot about solvent pop.</p>
<p>See, when you have too thick a layer of paint (which I did, when doing my &quot;rough look&quot; pass), and the top of it skins off,
some solvent might get trapped under it. What happens then is the trapped solvent  tries to evaporate, and can't: pressure builds, and it &quot;pops&quot;
the paint, making a tiny little pinhole.</p>
<p>So after 30 minutes, I pulled the plates out of the oven.  Yep, I got the pop a-plenty. Some areas of paint that were especially
thick got a ton of them.</p>
<p>I decided to stop <em>then</em>. Screw it. Rustoleum it is, as much as I hate the idea. This epoxy stuff is great (no, really, it is);
but I need to <em>spray</em> it.  So, I took a rag, wetted it with the solvent, and tried to rub the paint off.</p>
<p>Nope! It cured enough to no longer rub off with the reducer! Crap. Now, the only way to get it off is with Methylene Chloride
stripper... :(</p>
<p>Oh well. What's the best second option for a frustrated guy who failed at a paintjob at around 2 in the morning? Stop? Go to bed?
Strip and start anew?</p>
<p>Nope! I thought, &quot;well, I had a batch of clear right here. I can see if I can rub out the worst uglies with something, and try to
clear it to see if it'll hide the rest&quot;.</p>
<p>Admittedly, it did hide pretty neat.</p>
<p>I rubbed out the worst popped parts with maroon scotch brite, and sanded down the lettering.</p>

<p>What I should've done from the get go is either used Rustoleum, or got myself an airbrush. With an airbrush, it would've worked much nicer.</p>
<p>Maybe, I will strip them and re-do the paint. Maybe not - that kind of light is unusual in a cockpit. Maybe I will file this under
the &quot;don't be an idiot / don't rush a paintjob / use the right tools&quot; section, and keep them as a reminder - until I have
to make another set.</p>
<p>I don't know. We'll see.</p>

<hr class="dashed"/><p>So this one turned into a month long project, give or take. Sure, sure, I was doing other things, too: last one of which was completed
October 9th... after which I was finishing this one exclusively, pretty much.</p>
<p>Damn. One month to finish putting the brakes together. Granted, I had a hiatus for a week and a half, dealing with fixing up bad
(non-aircraft) plumbing and cutting (non-aircraft-grade) trees.</p>
<p>Regardless... Shall we?</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>After having <a class="reference external" href="http://79ft.net/entries/2019-09-30-brake-line/">finished making the new brake line</a>, I naturally wanted to install
it and call brakes done.</p>
<p>Some of the disassembly work documented here actually happened <em>prior</em> to the new line being bent up, but hey. Putting it all in one
place makes for a better narrative in <em>one</em> context.</p>

pads were soaked, from under the brake piston. Probably the o-ring was bust, and it was weeping from between
the caliper and the piston. It seems that it had been a feature of the plane for a while.</em></p>
<p><em>Jumping a bit ahead of myself, on the other side, I discovered the brake disk somewhat dirty with oil - crankcase breather hoses
are routed into the _left_ side wheelpant and terminate near the disk - clearly, spraying a bit of oil on and around it. You'll see
those hoses on the pics of the left wheel below.</em></p>
<p><em>I think Remo's idea was to prevent oil on the belly from the breather. My friend's Ben contention was, this was a brake lock-up
prevention measure; and when he brought it up, I immediately realized... leaking piston on the _right_ caliper was a lock-up
prevention measure as well - to make sure both brakes are equally slippery - right one with brake fluid, left one with motor
oil... At any rate,..</em></p>
<p>I will admit, this was my first caliper job ever, and anchor pins presented a bit of a problem. They're press fit in the
caliper, and I didn't have an arbor press. Well, I used an old 1/4 nut that I banged on (gently!), and finished with a drift punch....</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Flushed, and drying</p><p>Do you see the other mistake I made? Yep. I mixed up the bearings (&quot;front&quot; and &quot;back&quot;). Bearings should always stay with their races...</p>
<p>Oh well. After some research, seems that the worst that will happen is wear will get accelerated.. since the bearings and races
looked squeaky clean, I decided to keep them as is.. for now. And just Hail Mary the position (since I have a 50% chance of getting
it right :)).</p>
<p>I decided to replace all the felts because I was changing grease from I didn't know what kind but likely red Mobil grease to Aeroshell 22.</p>
<p>Ironically, I apparently didn't take a single picture of the bearings being greased - probably because my hands were too greasy doing them :). Oh well.</p>
<p>The new felts came, and got coated in grease.</p>

the cotter pin... I could either get it under-tight (with perceptible play in the bearings - not good), or a bit over-tight (so that
the wheel will spin, but with some measure of resistance). Remember, I said that my mistake number one was not checking how
freely this wheel spun prior to pulling it off? Now, I was paying for it.</p>
<p>I tried flipping the bearings around (because I didn't note their original positions), thinking that maybe that will help. Nope. No change
at all.</p>
<p>Oh well.  I couldn't do anything about that at that point, so decided to settle on &quot;a bit tighter&quot; option.</p>

got tightened to super tight, loosened, and tightened to finger tight - and the wheel was perfect. No play, and no &quot;drag&quot;.</p>

<h2>Bleeding</h2>
<p>Now, there are two approaches to bleeding brakes - either bottom up (push fluid up thru the bleeder valves), or top down (sit in the
plane and squeeze the pedals while the other guy opens and closes the bleeder). Bottom up is inherently simpler.</p>
<p>Some time ago, my buddy Dick was showing off his fancy bleeder he got from ATS.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">DIY brake bleeder</p><p>Pump it with air, open the valve, and the brake fluid gets pushed out thru the line that attaches to the bleeder valve on the caliper.
Child's play.</p>
<p>For bleeding, I dragged my good friend Nick S. to give me a helping hand. I could've done this by myself, but having someone watching over
the &quot;other end&quot; (it either being the end that pushes the fluid in, or the end out of which the fluid comes out) makes the job much
more pleasant.</p>
<p>Now, the way brakes are plumbed on the Charger is, each side goes from it's caliper up the gear leg to the parking brake valve, then
to the Master Cylinder, and from there both Master Cylinders are plumbed into a tee, from which the single line (the one I was re-making earlier) goes to the reservoir on the firewall.</p>
<p>We decided to bleed each side up to the tee first - to minimize the amount of air ending in the &quot;common&quot; line between the tee and the
firewall. After bleeding each side up to the tee, we'd attach the &quot;common&quot; line and bleed each side up to the reservoir, letting at least
a cup of fluid to flow thru, ensuring that we push all the air out.</p>

the hell the fluid won't flow. Hehe. Nick called it, too!</p>

initially, everything held just fine! Phew.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Lacing the wires to brake fluid line and structure</p><p>And finally, a couple more clamps along the length of the line on the fuse to hold it in place there. Some TorqSeal, and we're done!</p>
<p>I worked out a method to these, finally, I think. I use a long (~2 inches) AN3 bolt first to &quot;thread&quot; the clamps on, and then close them
with a wrap of lacing cord using the &quot;noose&quot; method (<a class="reference external" href="http://www.aeroelectric.com/articles/cable_lace/cable_lace.html">&quot;Method 2&quot; here</a>). I then remove the long bolt, install the final bolt, and start the nut. When the nut brings clamps almost to a close, I cut off the
nooses, and tighten the nut. Works like a charm!</p>

<p>PS: I was considering where to put this - under &quot;2019 Annual&quot; or &quot;Electrical Rebuild&quot; category... decided to pile it into the &quot;Electrical

<hr class="dashed"/><p>Prior to mounting the <a class="reference external" href="http://79ft.net/entries/2019-09-30-brake-line/">newly finished brake line</a>, I wanted to finish
fastening everything that's around it - so that I minimize wrenching around the brand new line.</p>
<p>Voltage Regulator is one of the bits that will go right there, so it was to be done.</p>
<p>I was working on it's mounting, on and off, and eventually got stuck with <a class="reference external" href="http://79ft.net/entries/2019-10-08-good-crimps/">attempting to solder a short grounding
strap</a> that was to go under one of the &quot;standoffs&quot; for the regulator.</p>
<p>And then, I was making the new brake line - but now that is done too. I also figured out how
to make that ground strap. So. nothing prevented me from completing the voltage regulator install.</p>
<p>But, we're getting ahead of ourselves.</p>
<p>First, the holes.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-10-09-vr-mounted/vr-2.jpg" title="Holes" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-10-09-vr-mounted/vr-2-thumb.jpg" title="Holes" alt="Holes" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Holes</p><p>How do you drill real good, round, quality holes, you ask?</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-10-09-vr-mounted/vr-3.jpg" title="Tools!" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-10-09-vr-mounted/vr-3-thumb.jpg" title="Tools!" alt="Tools!" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Tools!</p><p>Well. All those tools were participating in making of those holes, in sequence. Here's a game: name that sequence!</p>
<p>And then, the mounts. The regulator was to be on standoffs, to &quot;raise&quot; it above that rivet line.
The regulator wants two grounds, which will go under two of the standoffs. I also wanted to have a ground strap go under
a standoff.</p>
<p>Now, I have to explain the ground strap. I already mentioned spending quality time trying to make it.</p>
<p>I want to set up good grounding architecture in my all new electrical. This side conduit, to which the regulator is mounting, is key.</p>
<p>It's continuous, and aluminum - so it presents a really nice grounding point. I am planning to add jumpers between it and the
firewall, and it and the instrument panel, tying it all up nicely. Loads will be grounded to the conduit, firewall,
and instrument panel only.</p>
<p>Since the voltage regulator is right next to the firewall, it's very logical to have the ground strap under one of it's stands. And besides, there is already
a convenient hole right next to it for the firewall side of the grounding strap - which is why the strap is very short.</p>
<p>At any rate, those three terminals under three out of four standoffs for the regulator are making  hardware stacks of varying
thicknesses per standoff, so standoffs need to be individually sized to keep the regulator overall &quot;level&quot; above the conduit.</p>
<p>Another fly in the ointment is that &quot;jog&quot; created by one portion of the conduit riveted on top of another - that has to be
accounted for, too.</p>
<p>So four individual standoffs.</p>

<hr class="dashed"/><p>So, yet again, last few weeks turned into working on lots of little bits simultaneously.</p>
<p>But, finally, one of them is done - and therefore, something to log.. ahem, pardon, <em>b-log</em>, about :).</p>
<p>The brake line.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-09-30-brake-line/b-1.jpg" title="The old brake line" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-09-30-brake-line/b-1-thumb.jpg" title="The old brake line" alt="The old brake line" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">The old brake line</p><p>I needed to relocate this bad boy to free up room for the Voltage Regulator. This is the older picture - I have long
bent it out of the way and cut off a chunk. It was to be relocated to run below the conduit.</p>
<p>Well, first, we had to locate the hole in the firewall. And that depended on the line to the reservoir, firewall forward.</p>
<p>After having thunk a bit about it, decided to replace the 90 degree fitting in the reservoir with the 45 degree; and
the firewall bulkhead fitting with a 90 degree. That'd minimize the amount of bends and make for a neat job.</p>
<p>So, firewall forward we go first - that will locate the bulkhead fitting and the hole.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-09-30-brake-line/b-3.jpg" title="Mockup one" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-09-30-brake-line/b-3-thumb.jpg" title="Mockup one" alt="Mockup one" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Mockup one</p><p>This is with old fittings in the firewall and the reservoir. The clamp on the mockup line is using an existing
hole in the firewall - nice happenstance; I'd have to plug it with a &quot;blank&quot; bolt otherwise.</p>
<p>Then, &quot;project&quot; the tube onto the firewall, roughly mark the center, and drill!</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-09-30-brake-line/b-4.jpg" title="New hole!" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-09-30-brake-line/b-4-thumb.jpg" title="New hole!" alt="New hole!" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">New hole!</p><p>And now, to the most fun part. Making the tube.</p>
<p>This was another first - never done tubes and flares before, so first of, had to figure out how to flare them
properly.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-09-30-brake-line/b-16.jpg" title="Flaring tool" >

   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-09-30-brake-line/b-9-thumb.jpg" title="Practice (evidence)" alt="Practice (evidence)" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Practice (evidence)</p><p>Answer: 0.035. For the -4 tube. :) Yeah, those practice flares are not ALL the ones I made. Just some of them.</p>
<p>OKay, so the next question was how to actually make it fit.</p>
<p>My first thought was,</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-09-30-brake-line/b-5.jpg" title="Bottom hooked up, top not bent yet" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-09-30-brake-line/b-5-thumb.jpg" title="Bottom hooked up, top not bent yet" alt="Bottom hooked up, top not bent yet" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Bottom hooked up, top not bent yet</p><ul class="simple">
<li>Hook up the long portion (bottom)</li>
<li>Mark out the centerline of where the bend should be</li>
<li>Bend</li>
</ul>
<p>The tubing bender has alignments marks for where the marked CL should go for different angles of bends.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-09-30-brake-line/b-7.jpg" title="Marking centerline" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-09-30-brake-line/b-7-thumb.jpg" title="Marking centerline" alt="Marking centerline" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Marking centerline</p><p>What I didn't realize is that on this short a run, even a little error (bend being off of the ideal centerline by as little
as 1/16&quot;) would cause a total misalignment.</p>
<p>It did, of course.</p>
<p>Okay, second try.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-09-30-brake-line/b-10.jpg" title="Real material!" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-09-30-brake-line/b-10-thumb.jpg" title="Real material!" alt="Real material!" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Real material!</p><p>I pulled out the roll of the new tubing, too. Partly to motivate me. Partly because I ran out of the chunk I've cut off
of the old line.</p>
<p>This time, the idea was to bend it <em>first</em> and get the bend angle just right. Then, trim to correct length.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-09-30-brake-line/b-12.jpg" title="Bend angle first" >

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Trim, flare, hook up the bottom and mark the top</p><p>This actually worked.</p>
<p>Question. If you have a fitting with a flared end, where to place the cut mark, so that after you cut, and deburr, and
flare it, while it's sticking out of the flaring tool (un)-precisely 0.035&quot;, it fits?</p>
<p>Answer? I don't know. I think I got lucky :)</p>

<p>Okay, now, let's do the actual new line.</p>
<p>Unbend a long enough piece of tubing from the roll.
Pull out the old line. (and use it as a template!)</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">First two bends</p><p>Old line on the top, new on the bottom. I made the &quot;tip&quot; (that first section on the left) longer and planned to
flare it later - can you guess, will that bite me or not? ;)</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-09-30-brake-line/b-30.jpg" title="Getting close" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-09-30-brake-line/b-30-thumb.jpg" title="Getting close" alt="Getting close" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Getting close</p><p>Once I got to the point where the complex section (the one that goes from under the seat, to the side of the plane, and then up, and down again to run parallel to the conduit), it was time to try it on.</p>
<p>Maneuver it in.. it fits! Perfect! Bends clear all the right spots and fit in all the tight places.</p>
<p>Okay, now, time to actually attach it to the fitting under the passenger seat, hook it up with temp clamps, and do final bends
and trim to final length in place.</p>
<p>But first, I need to flare that end - the one to go under the seat, where I left somewhat a longer stub to be trimmed later.</p>
<p>I trim it. Perfect length.</p>
<p>Crap! It does not go into my flaring tool now.  It's way too short for it. WAAAY too short.</p>
<p>See, the flaring tool has some thickness to it. The sleeve has to fit on the tubing before you flare, and takes up another 1/4&quot;
of it's length. And, it won't go thru the bend. So there's a certain minimum length of straight tubing required for you to be
able to flare it.</p>
<p>And, I already cut it off :( And I can't unbend it - it'll just break.</p>
<p><em>Okay, I'll admit to this. I did try to unbend it. I annealed it back to soft (torch + sharpie as temp indicator) and
actually did succeed at it. But, bend flattens the tube some - and the sleeve still won't go over it.</em></p>
<p><em>Besides, bending this big Kahuna was actually not that hard - much easier than I thought, with old line acting as
template. And, I  had enough tubing. So, I decided to re-bend a new one</em>.</p>
<p>Second try, I flared <em>first</em>. And then, I realized that Remo has probably bent his with a different kind of bender, or had
a different kind of flaring tool - my bender would make that first section a bit longer than what the original line had.</p>
<p>Well... it wouldn't interfere with anything (I checked). It'll make it run a bit at an angle, and stick out from the
seat a bit more... a bit uglier, but not a big deal (and I'll try to massage it into a bit more parallel run during final
install).</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Still needs to be bent and trimmed</p><p>There'll need to be two more bends - &quot;down&quot; to follow the conduit and &quot;out&quot; to hook up to the bulkhead fitting on the firewall.</p>
<p>That geometry would need to ensure that I have enough straight tube to successfully flare it - learned my lesson there :).</p>
<p>So, our little safety wire mockup to the rescue.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">First bend made, marking / eyeballing the second</p><p>What I didn't realize is that this long line is much easier than a short stub. Even if you make a mistake, you can massage
the line into compliance, &quot;smudging&quot; your mistake over the whole length - mistakes like wrong angle, a bit short here, etc.</p>
<p>Though, marking precisely does help. :)</p>

<hr class="dashed"/><p>...this is important. Stick a pin in it.</p>
<p>Remo had these nice placards all over the airplane. Professionally done. Very well looking. He probably ordered them
somewhere, or used a technique I am not aware of.</p>
<p>These placards are mostly glued on, and do not come off.</p>
<p>How do I know?</p>
<p>Well, I needed to remove <em>one</em>, in the side conduit. Here it is,..</p>

<p>Ha!</p>
<p>You'll see.</p>
<p>Read on.</p>
<div class="section" id="switch-anti-rotation-holes">
<h2>Switch Anti-Rotation Holes</h2>
<p>You have probably figured by now that I have a taste for misery, and for ranting about how miserable that or this was :). If
you read a <em>few</em> notes in this Dear Diary, you will notice a trend - that I tend to come up with ways  of making myself
aggravated, very consistently and reliably.</p>
<p>Well, this time it was the &quot;anti-rotation&quot; holes for switches in the panel; and the plan was to drill them from
the <em>back side</em> of the panel <em>not quite all the way thru</em> (yay, no access and contortionism again!)</p>
<p>Every switch, circuit breaker, and certainly, a dimmer, comes with a &quot;keyed&quot; washer to prevent it's rotation. That means
you're drilling two holes - one for the appliance (switch, or whatever), and the other for the little tab that's on the
washer.</p>
<p>Picture explains this better. Here is a little hole template I quickly drew in Solidworks, properly dimensioned,
with washers from (left to right) the circuit breaker, switch, and the dimmer.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-09-10-panel-holes-compass/p-2.jpg" title="Holes template" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-09-10-panel-holes-compass/p-2-thumb.jpg" title="Holes template" alt="Holes template" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Holes template</p><p>See, Remo didn't have those &quot;secondary&quot; holes on the panel - so I had to drill them (especially for the dimmer).</p>
<p>But wait, you ask. If you drill holes, that will be ugly - a hole next to every switch?</p>
<p>Yup. Aha. Agreed! Though the nuts are supposed to cover them, they, I'm pretty sure, from my testing at least, wouldn't
have...</p>
<p>No problem! Remo made the panel from 1/8&quot; thick aluminum, and I needed maybe <em>half</em> that much for the tabs to go in. So
the plan was to very carefully drill them just deep enough to house the tabs.</p>
<p>Made me a nice little set of templates...</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-09-10-panel-holes-compass/p-3.jpg" title="Templates in the making" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-09-10-panel-holes-compass/p-3-thumb.jpg" title="Templates in the making" alt="Templates in the making" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Templates in the making</p><p>...out of a small piece of aluminum, drilled holes using my paper template, and cut them up...</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-09-10-panel-holes-compass/p-4.jpg" title="Templates, cut up" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-09-10-panel-holes-compass/p-4-thumb.jpg" title="Templates, cut up" alt="Templates, cut up" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Templates, cut up</p><p>...and cleaned up the holes and edges.</p>
<p>The plan was, to put a template like a &quot;washer&quot; around a switch/CB/..., and center punch the secondary, small, hole, thru it.
Then, I'll have punch marks to drill, and will have to either get to them from the side of the plane, or, more likely, from the <em>back</em> of
the panel while sitting in the seat and <em>not seeing where they are while drilling</em>, using a mirror to position the drill
first.</p>
<p>Like I said, I have a taste for misery.</p>
<p>So there we went, punching the back side.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Center-punching on the back side of the panel</p><p>Click-clickity-clack.</p>
<p>Cling! Ding! Ding dang dong.. it sounded like a chunk of metal just fell off the plane and dropped on the cockpit floor.</p>
<p>!??!?&#64;??!??! <em>What the h... did I break?!</em></p>
<p>I crawled out from behind the panel and looked into the cockpit.</p>
<p>On the floor, looking at me, and almost smiling, was...</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Placard!</p><p>...this. Remo's placard that went around the switches. Like so:</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-09-10-panel-holes-compass/p-2-3.jpg" title="Placards - in place" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-09-10-panel-holes-compass/p-2-3-thumb.jpg" title="Placards - in place" alt="Placards - in place" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Placards - in place</p><p>Wait, wait wait wait. It came <em>off</em>. But it will be held back by the switches' nuts when the switches are in. And.. cover
the holes! That means, I don't need to drill the holes from the back side and worry about punching thru (or not going deep enough) - I can comfortably sit in the cockpit and
drill them from the front! All the way thru! The placard will cover them! In my search for misery, did I luck out?! :)</p>
<p>In retrospect, this (and the opposite side's) placard were probably not glued. No need - switches' nuts hold them just fine.</p>
<p>They were stuck because Remo probably installed them on top of the paint that didn't fully cure - and it just stuck to the backside
of placards over the years, under the pressure from switches' nuts.</p>
<p>I stuck my nail under the opposite side placard, and it came off with a little force.</p>
<p>Ha!</p>
<p>Well, it was smooth sailing from there...</p>

<p>Looking around, looking around.... aha! Here's a number 8 or 10 screw plugging a hole! I can enlarge it and we'll be
in business! (marked (1)).</p>
<p>Yep. Good luck, buddy. That was an even <em>bigger</em> hole that was plugged with a #8 screw in a countersunk finishing
washer... hmmm... maybe that will work out for the pot too?</p>
<p>You know, drilling a #10 countersunk washer to have a 1/4&quot; hole in it is... hard? Annoying? You can't really grip
it in any manner without damaging it, you can't hold it in your fingers... I think I lucked out on my third try, with combination
of a Unibit and light clamping of that washer in a vice.</p>
<p>With that re-drilled countersunk washer, the pot mounts just fine in hole #2. And #1 got plugged back :).</p>

<h2>Compass Mount</h2>
<p>Well, after all that excitement compass mount was almost anti climactic. I toyed with the idea of putting it into the panel
(and relocating G-meter into a new hole I'd cut around where the ignition switch was - see, after
<a class="reference external" href="http://79ft.net/entries/2019-09-08-fwf-side-channel-panel-layouts/">having failed relocating Hobbs there</a>, the idea of still
making a bigger hole in the panel keeps nagging me :).</p>
<p>No good. When that much down, too much steel around it confuses the compass to the tune of about 30 degrees... No need to
add extra problems in already a magnetically problematic plane.</p>
<p>So, top it was to be. The windshield will get in the way, but I really, really didn't want to take it off (~20 #6
screws and nuts in a tight spot is no fun).</p>
<p>Eyeballed the bracket alignment with the fuselage centerline and put it in the right spot...</p>

<hr class="dashed"/><p>I was on the fence about making this entry as multiple separate ones versus just one giant one... After all, it covers
quite a few, mostly unrelated, things that I did in the last few days, and it would've made sense to keep
them separate.</p>
<p>However; finally decided to make just one big article with all of them. None of them are finished; but somewhat a decent
chunk of work is - I think I have <em>mostly</em> figured out where everything will go and how it will all come together.</p>
<p>I guess, what I'm trying to say is, if you clicked on the &quot;Panel Layout&quot; entry in the Log, and are trying to figure out why
are you seeing notes on Firewall Forward, just keep scrolling :).</p>
<div class="section" id="diagram">
<h2>Diagram</h2>
<p>I have updated the electrical diagram, version 2 is <a class="reference external" href="/files/6781G-new-electrical/6781G-wiring-diagram.v2.pdf">here</a>.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Main Connector is gone. I was convinced that reliability concerns outweigh the benefits of having it. Plus, I have very
little precious room to work with.</li>
<li>Physically, it's easier to hook up the LR3C Sense wire to a different spot - on the Shunt stud rather than to the
Master Contactor/Starter Contactor jumper directly. It makes no difference, it's the same circuit - just a different hookup spot to it.</li>
<li>I also fixed some typos, and cleaned up a bit.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Firewall Forward</h2>
<p>I started trying things around firewall forward while
<a class="reference external" href="http://79ft.net/entries/2019-09-01-carb-cables/">figuring out routing and lengths for carb control cables</a>, and continued
afterwards.</p>
<div class="section" id="contactors-and-beefy-wires">
<h3>Contactors and Beefy Wires</h3>
<div class="section" id="contactors">
<h4>Contactors</h4>
<p>It became obvious fairly quickly that I won't be able to use the nice B&amp;C Starter Contactor because of it's mounting
holes not being the same as a very common SS581 Starter Solenoid that was set up by Remo. Also, the way terminals
were set up on the B&amp;C Starter Contactor would have made them closer to the carb control cables. And, I didn't want to drill more
holes in the firewall.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">SS581 Contactor</p><p>So I decided to go with SS581-style and ordered one from Vans. While waiting for it, I used the old one just to mock
things up.</p>
<p>And because it doesn't have the spike catcher diode, I had to get me a couple IN5400s, and soldered an extension lead to one
of them.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Extension lead</p><p>The other leg will get a crimp ring terminal. I had to do that 'cause the diode leads themselves weren't long enough.</p>

<div class="section" id="battery-and-starter-wires">
<h4>Battery and Starter Wires</h4>
<p>Those are the thickest wires, and routing them is more complicated than the other ones. In addition, the
battery + -&gt; master contactor wire is the only wire that can't be turned off, and therefore needs to be very well
thought out and as short as possible.</p>
<p>Here's something else, too. The Charger was set up to ground the battery to the motor. So far, so good - starter is by far
the largest consumer in the electrical system. However, nothing was done to ground the motor to the rest of the airplane!</p>
<p>So the rest of the system was probably grounded via whatever metal to metal connections there were on the motor.
Control cables and braided fuel and oil hoses? ;) Airbox bowden &quot;carb heat&quot; cable... I can't think of much more else.</p>
<p>Initially, I was planning to run a ground strap braid from the battery negative to one of the bolts holding the battery
box to the firewall, but with fuel system components and control cables around, just couldn't figure out a good way to run
it and support it. I had to end up settling for running it to the engine mount instead.</p>
<p>So the bottom line is, the negative 4GA cable is gonna go to the motor, and parallel to it a braid will go to the motor mount.
I also figured out a clamp arrangement with some standoffs that will keep the wires neat and organized.</p>

that, it would not let the ANL covers to come on. So, before doing anything drastic, I decided to check to see how it
would look with the wire jumpers</p>

<h2>Side Conduit</h2>
<p>The Voltage Regulator and the Main Terminal/Fuse Block were to go to the Side Conduit running alongside the fuselage.</p>

   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-09-08-fwf-side-channel-panel-layouts/cond-1-thumb.jpg" title="Rough component locations" alt="Rough component locations" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Rough component locations</p><p>I had to relocate the bowdens lower to free up some space.  The Oil Cooler box on this plane is all sorts of weird, including a flapper valve controlled by one of those bowdens that closes up the airflow to it (which is not enough to begin with; being a 1.5&quot; SCAT takeoff off of back baffle.. but don't get me started on that). That cable turned out to be too short when
relocated - but I lucked out - Glenn had a bowden going to the Rotec TBI that I removed for &quot;prime&quot; function, and that bowden was plenty
long. I'll trim it to final length when I'm done in that side conduit.</p>
<p>The brake tube was running inside the conduit, and I will have to relocate it to run below the conduit and be supported
by adel clamps. For now, I unhooked it and used it to somewhat mock up the new run. Tube and fittings ordered,
and tubing bender already here!</p>
<div class="section" id="fuse-block">
<h3>Fuse Block</h3>
<p>I was gonna use a 20-position fuse block from B&amp;C. Well, <em>that</em> didn't go too well.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-09-08-fwf-side-channel-panel-layouts/cond-2.jpg" title="Fuse block" >

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Fuse block</p><p>Tight! I basically lose the whole top row of fuses with it. Not enough room....</p>
<p>After poking around the Internets for a bit, came to these nice fuse blocks made by Blue Sea Systems. Longest ones they
have are 8 fuses, so I will need two (if I recall correctly, I have 13 fuses in the diagram currently, and I want some spare
positions for later if I need them).</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-09-08-fwf-side-channel-panel-layouts/cond-17.jpg" title="Blue Sea Systems fuse block" >

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Blue Sea Systems fuse block</p><p>Much better! Plus, they use ring terminals rather than tabs - and while tabs are light and simple, I don't like them.
Removing them is hard, and, when removed, the terminal loses a lot of it's grip. It's almost like an &quot;assemble once&quot; type
deal.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="voltage-regulator">
<h3>Voltage Regulator</h3>
<p>With how the wire harness is gonna go in that conduit, and with bowdens being where they are, the best orientation for the
Voltage Regulator would've been &quot;upside down&quot;, with terminal strip up.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Upside Down orientation</p><p>Damn you, the yellow sticker on the regulator! DAMN you! (hint: read it :) ).</p>
<p>Mounting it sideways, I'd have a line of rivet heads under it - which I didn't want to deal with.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Sideways orientation</p><p>And mounting it down... Down was annoying because of the clamp for bowdens and bowdens close there. That would also
complicate wiring.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Down orientation</p><p>Upside down would've been perfect... except for that yellow sticker :). So, I decided to Hail Mary and asked nice folks at
B&amp;C about what they thought.</p>
<p>See, the problem is I know why they wanted the terminal strip to be pointed down. It's so that water won't get into the
box in case of condensation accumulating on it. But I thought, maybe I can seal it somehow?</p>
<p>The answer from TJ at B&amp;C was a resounding no. Right side up, sideways - but not upside down.</p>
<p>So I mocked up the right side up mounting...</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-09-08-fwf-side-channel-panel-layouts/cond-12.jpg" title="Right side up mockup" >

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Right side up mockup</p><p>Yuck. Yeah; it'd work; but it's ugly as hell.</p>
<p>The only other option would be sideways, but on &quot;standoffs&quot; of sorts to clear the rivet heads. I mentioned that to TJ, and he
said that that could work, but I should check if I can access the voltage adjustment screw on the top of the box.</p>
<p>Damn it! I forgot about it. On the top of the box there's a plug over a hole that opens up access to a tiny screw to adjust
buss voltage - basically, to fine tune how much volts the battery sees. Not something you do often, but you want to be able
to do it.</p>
<p>But then, TJ mentioned that he saw the holes in the firewall and that might be the saving grace.</p>
<p>Bingo!</p>
<p>I tried it out again in vertical, now with mocked up standoffs</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Vertical</p><p>With just enough aggravation due to bad access (mandatory in aviation pretty much), you can undo the bolt covering the hole
in the firewall (this hole was left over from the brake line relocation), pop the plug on the voltage regulator, and
just have enough access to the adjustment screw.</p>

held by an aluminum backplate and
four nylock nuts, so I <em>had</em> to have a wrench over them the <em>whole</em> time. Oh, the screws are way too long BTW, so taking all

Removed VSI to give me a bit more room to work with.</p>
<p>I tried to reconstruct exactly what happened next in my memory to write it down here, and could not.
I was basically fiddling, checking clearances, making sure I'll be able to hook up the punch and center the hole, have
enough room for the mounting ring in the back and clear everything I had to clear, when I discovered that...</p>
<p>The Hobbs was <em>not</em> a standard 2 1/4 inch gauge - it was a touch <em>bigger</em>. So the hole that I would've made would've been
too small for it. And that if I punched the hole, I would've been just left with a bigger hole and nothing to
put in there.</p>
<p>Damn, damn, damn! Damn you, assumptions that every &quot;small&quot; gauge on an airplane is 2 1/4!</p>
<p>And I had the expensive punch that I had no use for :(.</p>
<p>Oh well. Thanks God I actually did <em>not</em> do it - only to have a <em>larger</em> hole to plug up. I guess, that Hobbs is (thru
more contortionism) going back to the front panel.</p>
<p>As they say, Le Sigh.</p>

around and pretend turning them on and off), the <em>best</em>, layout.</p>

<p>I am going to replace Pilot's whiskey compass with a vertical card one - yes, I am directionally retarded :) It's not
that expensive a mod in the grand scheme of things; and is the only directional instrument available to pilot on this

<p>It's a bit taller than the whiskey compass, so I'm playing with different mount locations. I think this is what it will be;
with shock isolating rubber pad under the mount where the gap is at the moment.</p>

<hr class="dashed"/><p>Even before Oshkosh, I have decided to replace the Rotec TBI the Charger had when I got it with a good old MA4-SPA carb. In short,
I do not trust the damn thing - especially with it being the sole component providing two out of three vertices
of the proverbial fire triangle to the motor. That reminds me, I need to summarize my thoughts on Rotec...</p>
<p>Regardless, one of the things  I got at Oshkosh was a rebuilt MA4-SPA from Spruce, and it was sitting in the
hangar waiting it's turn. I knew I would need to order new control cables for it, so I decided to get that going, after
all the alternator business was finished, because getting those cables will take me a bit.</p>
<p><em>Here's a fun aside. I knew this motor had a MA4 carb and Glenn &quot;upgraded&quot; it to the Rotec TBI. What I didn't
know was precisely what kind of MA4-SPA it had (and there are quite a few models of that carb).</em></p>
<p><em>No problem. At Oshkosh, I went to nice folks from Tempest (which now owns MA Carbs) and had a very nice conversation with them.
I asked if I should buy the carb from them, and they recommended Spruce instead, because it would be cheaper that way.
And, they mentioned the $600 core charge (I'll spell this out - you must provide a good &quot;core&quot; (old carburetor) or get
charged extra six hundred bucks). Ouch.</em></p>
<p><em>Ha! thought I. I am at Oshkosh! What could be easier than getting an old carburetor, especially since it's one of the
most widespread models? No problem at all!</em></p>
<p><em>Laughing, I ran that by guys from Tempest. They laughed with me, and actually were very very very helpful, telling me
what to look for when picking up an old carb.</em></p>
<p><em>No cracks in the body. Control arms should be present. Threads nice and not torn up. Venturi present. Etc etc etc.</em></p>
<p><em>Well, to the FlyMart we went, and sure enough, on a bench there laid a number of MA4-SPAs present, ranging from
$250 to $450. Of course, I picked up the $250 one (it was yellowtagged by the way! In 1995, if I recall), dragged it
over to Spruce, ordered a new carb, and handed them the old one I just picked up. So, $350 saved in about half a mile
of walking. Not bad!</em></p>
<p>Here it is, in all it's glory, hooked up to my motor. You guys should admire my &quot;economizer design&quot; gasket. Hmm... I need to patent that and start selling them for $100/pop. <em>Your fuel costs will go to 0! Now, you might not be going too far... but..
Fuel costs! Zero! With all the benefits, not going anywhere is such an insig....</em> Ahem.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Carb</p><p>Well, okay. The carb was on, and cables came next.</p>
<p>The Rotec had it's control cables for mixture and throttle done completely differently than the carb. Glenn reused Throttle
cable for Mixture on the TBI - it worked out well. He added a new cable, routed completely differently, for the TBI's
Throttle.</p>
<p>Since this motor was originally carbureted, all I had to do is reverse engineer a bit the way Remo did the hookups.</p>
<p>Hehe.</p>
<p>Well, Throttle on the carb side wasn't that bad.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">With a Clevis</p><p>It actually worked out a bit better with a Clevis, having the cable end centered nicely on the throttle arm. So I
decided to do the clevis.</p>
<p>Next was confirming the &quot;throw&quot; - making sure that the throttle control range of motion, whatever it is, is sufficient
(in fact, it must have some extra &quot;padding&quot; in it) to move the throttle stop to stop. Boy, was I in for a treat.</p>
<p>This Charger has <em>reversing</em> throttle quadrants, meaning that when the throttle goes forward,
the actual control is pulled  backward. Since forward on the control must translate into forward on the carburetor, the
Charger has bellcranks to reverse the motion once again. These bellcranks are also a nice spot to tune out the <em>range</em>
of motion.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-09-01-carb-cables/c-3.jpg" title="Control linkage" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-09-01-carb-cables/c-3-thumb.jpg" title="Control linkage" alt="Control linkage" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Control linkage</p><p>See, the relative distance of the top and bottom holes on the bellcrank to it's pivot point &quot;convert&quot; whatever range
of motion is on the control (throttle quadrant) side to an appropriate range of motion on the carburetor side.</p>
<p>And Glenn changed them.</p>
<p>Not a surprise. The Rotec TBI had it's controls set up very differently as compared to a carb. Notice how in the picture
the color of those bellcranks is somewhat off from the rest of the fuselage? That was my first clue...</p>
<p>My second clue was finding one of those bellcrank plates (minus the bearing) in the box of parts that I got with the airplane.</p>
<p>My third clue was me not being able to get the full range on the throttle.</p>
<p>Crap!</p>
<p>I am absolutely not set up to redo the bellcranks. Though they look simple, unless I want to make them from 3/16&quot; steel, which
would make them very, very, VERY heavy, I'd need a TIG welder. Or to MacGyver things with washers. And do quite a lot of
trial and error.</p>
<p>I wanted to see if I could luck out.</p>
<p>Credit goes to Glenn here - he made his new bellcranks <em>perfect</em> for the TBI. The range of motion on them was just right...
for the TBI. Because of that, they were asymmetrical - so I thought; maybe, just <em>maybe</em>, if I was to try them in different
combinations, I would luck out...</p>
<p>And I did!</p>
<p>Now, these two paragraphs of text and one picture is me describing... about 3 or 4 hours of work - tweaking cables,
turning bellcranks, checking, rinsing, and repeating. I think I did find a combination of orientation of these that gave
me <em>acceptable</em> (but by no means perfect) ranges of motion. I think I lost about an inch on both of the controls, but
that's not so bad, after all - you want extra room in your control's range of movement to make absolutely positive
you can move the controlled thing stop to stop.</p>
<p>Okay, Mixture's next.</p>
<p>I hooked up the cable that Glenn used for throttle to the mixture control on the carb, to use as a &quot;mock up&quot;,
and kinda fished it thru.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-09-01-carb-cables/c-1-4.jpg" title="Mixture cable hookup" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-09-01-carb-cables/c-1-4-thumb.jpg" title="Mixture cable hookup" alt="Mixture cable hookup" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Mixture cable hookup</p><p>I had to use a rod end here. The cable wouldn't line up with the control arm on the carb for me to be able to
use a Clevis there.... See how angled and offset that hookup is? I think Remo had a solid bowden cable style control
there...</p>
<p>Another problem with the Mixture control is that the carb's arm has a 1/4&quot; hole.. the rod ends need a #10 screw; which
means that the hole on the carb arm is too large. No biggie though, I'll add a bushing to reduce it.</p>
<p>Yet another problem is that the bolt's head is way too close to the carb bowl, and I had to have it reversed like
that (bolt &quot;upside down&quot;).</p>
<p>There's not a lot of room on the top either. Planning to  fix this problem with using of 1/2
size shear nut, and figuring out the exact bolt length (I ordered every bolt between -4 and -10 sizes).</p>
<p>And now, the routing of those cables.</p>
<p>The throttle cable routing was a given. I did not like too tight a radius in one of it's &quot;turns&quot;.</p>
<p>I wanted to try to optimize the routing..... ha. Good luck there buddy! The battery box gets in the way (the battery is
in a completely wrong place on this plane... it's reversed with the oil cooler. Oil cooler should be on the left. Battery
on the right. This makes controls routing a breeze. But no.....).</p>
<p>I wanted to make sure to keep the mixture cable to not be too close to the beefy 4 AWG cable that will go from
the battery to the master relay.</p>
<p>I had to reverse engineer previous routing of the cable, and figure out the best points to hook it up to the firewall.</p>
<p>I wanted to have my ANL fuse bases close to the master and starter relay. Ha! No way, with the control cables
the way they would have to be.</p>
<p>All this was an exercise in misery, and lots and lots of time. I wanted too much.</p>
<p>In the end, the routing of the throttle will stay the same; the cable will just be shortened to make one of the
turn radiusii bigger. The mixture will go nearby, and curl around the battery box.</p>
<p>I will not be able to use any other arrangement of solenoids and will have to stick to the old one. What's worse,
I will not be able to use the new solenoid I got from B&amp;C - it's mounting holes are very different, and, frankly,
it's not worth it to drill more holes in already a sieve-like firewall - I'll stick with the classic &quot;style&quot;.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Approx. new routing</p><p>The mixture cable does look like it'll interfere with the solenoids, I know. In the final setup, it will be pulled
away from the firewall and clamped to a couple of points I found.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>More bad news? I long noticed a leak from the left brake bleeder valve; and decided to add a new valve to my next order from Spruce.
I thought it was a basic valve problem. Well,  went to look for it's dimensions, and found out the source of the damn
leak, actually... Looks like someone tried to fix a leak there by making a bigger leak. The fun thing was, I didn't notice
this before - the brake was too dirty...</p>

<p>Okay. I'm lying to you. This template is not the one I used. It was done with the long belt that ended up not working out,
so I had to redo the template (thanks God, just the template). The new one was done in the same manner as the one I described
above.</p>
<p>Here it is:</p>

<div class="section" id="solidworks">
<h2>Solidworks!</h2>
<p>It's magic, I keep telling people.</p>
<p>So, we take our  template, and scan it on a scanner, along with a little metal ruler to give us physical dimensions. Then, we go to Solidworks, start a sketch, and insert the scan as &quot;sketch picture&quot;. Using the image of the ruler <em>that was scanned in</em>, we tell Solidworks what &quot;one inch&quot; on this picture is. Boom! The image is now dimensionally accurate.</p>
<p>Then, we start drawing around it.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-08-31-alternator-pivot-arm/b-8.jpg" title="Initial sketch" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-08-31-alternator-pivot-arm/b-8-thumb.jpg" title="Initial sketch" alt="Initial sketch" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Initial sketch</p><p>Above, I positioned the top hole, and the four 5/16&quot; holes around bolt imprints. I then sketched a large circle and made it <em>tangent</em> to three out of four of those holes - it defines the &quot;pivot arc&quot;. Then, offsetting it 5/16th gives me the other &quot;side&quot; of the slot; and offsetting it more gives me the &quot;sides&quot; of the bracket in the &quot;pivot arc&quot; area.</p>
<p>I also started sketching the &quot;no go&quot; lines around the top portion of the bracket.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-08-31-alternator-pivot-arm/b-9.jpg" title="More circles" >

 </a> <p class="small text-center">More circles</p><p>More circles and lines are added, and off-set. They are not positioned or dimensioned - just made <em>tangent</em> to &quot;no go&quot; lines.
You can almost see the outline of the pivot arm, yes? ;)</p>
<p>Now, we take this master sketch; and add arc elements with real lines that we care about.</p>

<p>By the way. How do you &quot;measure&quot; the round over of the B&amp;C arm? Radius gauge? Calipers? Hmmm.. Or...</p>

<p>Next, we print the drawing of our new part; making sure our holes' centers are marked (we'll use that later to drill
them)</p>

<p>Also, lesson number one learned: drilling oil (I used TapMagic) gets under the template, and messes up the glue (and
unglues it). I need to figure out a better glue.</p>
<p>I drilled the slot's &quot;start&quot; and &quot;end&quot; holes slightly undersized, and reamed the main attachment hole to 5/16ths exactly.</p>
