<hr class="dashed"/><p>Well, damn. With almost a year (no, more than a year!) of my being a caretaker of the Chickenhouse Charger, I
finally was about to actually begin what I have started - which was, putting in <em>my</em> wires.</p>
<p>I decided to start at the switches, and run from the panel forward. Some wires will terminate at the fuse blocks
(power feeds), and some will go forward - to the front panel, voltage regulator, and firewall forward.</p>
<p>Then, I was planning to run a few wires backwards - the ones that were pre-terminated on my transducers (fuel,
oil pressures, oil temp, and mag pickup for the tach).</p>
<p>Immediately, I will admit: <strong>that was a mistake</strong>. While the harness turned out alright, it could've been
much neater - if I ran in one direction. I could've made sure the whole thing is wire to wire and perfectly
clean. So I should've run front to back, because my pre-terminated wires all &quot;started&quot; upfront.</p>
<p>In other words, prop to tail. Well sigh. Next time. On the other hand, this approach would've made terminating
switches at the panel a nightmare. That was, initially, the reason why I wanted to start at the panel - so that
I'd pre-attach wires to switches, tie them up, and then trim them at the other end.</p>
<p>At any rate.... Shall we?</p>
<div class="section" id="prep">
<h2>Prep</h2>
<p>Couple things to knock off before I started wiring was to complete the back panel. One thing that was
left was the compass correction card bracket. No problem, drilled and tapped a couple holes for #2 brass screws.</p>
<p>Here's Mr. M. installing it:</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Compass Correction Card Bracket</p><p>The other one was the inertia switch for the smoke system. Glenn had it in for &quot;safety&quot;: in the event of a
shock (crash?) the switch breaks the circuit. I am.. not sure why he would have it, but he had it.</p>
<p>I considered not putting it back in, but what the hell.</p>
<p>Here's the switch:</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Shock switch</p><p>The problem was, it sat tightly between other switches in the panel. With old layout, that barely worked; but with
the new layout, and Honeywell double throw switches, the connector plug was getting in the way. So I had to resort
to some vandalism. :)</p>

<h2>Panel</h2>
<p>Now ready, I decided to install the switches first, and then wire them from the back. I needed a couple short jumpers
though to connect them, and to set up some wires to be the exact length. That'd be impossible with switches
installed in the panel (too little access), so I set up an old placard plate, installed switches into it,
and worked on those jumpers and terminations on the bench before moving them to the airplane.</p>

specifically, Raychem SCL. It's 3:1 and it is very rigid - almost completely rigid. It definitely adds more
support than the typical PIDG crimp used everywhere.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Somewhere in the middle of running the wires</p><p>I think it happened when I was yet again sitting in the cockpit, clicking the switches and enjoying the very
well done Honeywell's action.....</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Engine starter engaged position - note that I can hit the starter and hold the throttle with the same hand</p><p>...when it dawned on me...</p>
<p>My three most important switches, L and R Mags, and Master, were set up with lockouts - you couldn't turn them on
just by clicking them, instead, having to pull the lever first to move it to the &quot;on&quot; position. I mostly
did that to protect from accidental too playful a kid in the cockpit.</p>
<p>But they weren't locked out in the &quot;on&quot; position!</p>
<p>Why is that important? Well, the Smoke and the Fuel Pump - the most <em>operated</em> switches on this plane - are
right there. Note how their levers are shorter? If I accidentally hit the longer levered Master, or a Mag, switch,
that would turn it <em>off</em> - with me potentially shutting down the motor. While a remote possibility, improving
the situation would amount to just replacing the switches to the ones with lockouts in <em>both</em> on <em>and</em> off positions.</p>
<p>I don't know how I missed that when designing the original setup...</p>
<p>I decided to do it.</p>
<p>So out came the switches, I had to un-wire the terminals from the back. In went the order for three new
switches with now correct lock-outs.</p>
<p>About a week later, I had them, and could proceed.</p>
<p>With left side wired up, I could tie it down. Mind you, access there is tight and from all kinds of
weird angles :).</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Extreme Soldering</p><p>For those lighting wires, and for the turn coordinator, routing took some fiddling with. My initial plan would've
had them rubbing against the sides of the gauges, and I decided to bring them &quot;out&quot; and away - that's why I had to
extend them, by the way.</p>

<p>The right side of the panel was much easier - it held much smaller, and simpler circuits, for lights and turn
and bank.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Right side</p><p>You can see the beginnings of the ground strap to bond the panel with the &quot;side conduit&quot;, holding the fuse
blocks and being one of the grounding points. In my <a class="reference external" href="http://79ft.net/entries/2019-08-11-design-v1/">original design</a>,
I had firewall, motor, &quot;side conduit&quot;, and panel, as ground points - all bonded with those straps.</p>
<p>Here's the right side:</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2020-07-26-wiring-1/w-59.jpg" title="Right side" >

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Panel bonding strap</p><p>(the bonding strap got enclosed in super flexible heatshrink just for neatness: this is a fit-up picture).</p>
<p>I also had some fun with ADELs right where the wires turn from the &quot;side conduit&quot; towards the panel.
I had to clear and negotiate a couple bowdens, and the engine monitor harness was unwieldy.</p>
<p>I think that took a number of hours, just trying various setups, the final one that I really liked was this:</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Engine monitor and carb heat bowden.</p><p>I replaced all the ugly zipties with lacing, of course :).</p>
<p>Meanwhile, on the outside, to keep the wires nicely separated, I spread them out in kind of a &quot;fan&quot; in the order
they ran, back to front:</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2020-07-26-wiring-1/w-44.jpg" title="Wire fan" >

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Wire fan</p><p>A day later, I replaced the tape with a comb. Yep, a cheapo $1 comb :) Worked out great.</p>
<p>And finally, before committing and continuing, I checked each wire for gauge, and proper circuitry.</p>

<div class="section" id="side-contuit-part-i">
<h2>Side Contuit, Part I</h2>
<p>With all those wires sticking out, it was now time to start figuring out routing in the side conduit. All the wires
that had to go forward had, well, to go forward.</p>
<p>After lots of fiddling, I ended up with this:</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Initial stab at the side conduit routing</p><p>I had to clear all the brackets, and other sharp things. Ended up adding a couple more ADELs (and drilling holes
in the conduit to accommodate). Also, reused some existing holes, made a few standoffs for ADELs and such.</p>

<div class="section" id="front-panel">
<h2>Front Panel</h2>
<p>The most interesting piece in it was a Westach tach, that fed directly off of a P-Lead and required a .25A
fuse. Glenn used a 1A classic glass fuse, but I decided to do it right. See, the thing is, if it fails &quot;short
circuit&quot;, that'd turn off the mag - I guess that's why the fuse is in there.</p>
<p>The tach would get another 20GA shielded wire, just like a p-lead, and I decided to join it to right mag's
p-lead at the magneto - instead of splicing it into the p-lead running front to back in the side conduit.</p>
<p>But, back to the fuse. I figured, I'd build it into my connector that hooks up to the tach. Then, if blown,
the connector could be rebuilt. Yep, it's more annoying than a regular replaceable fuse, but that circuit is
not critical, and I had no room for a &quot;regular&quot; fuse block or holder.</p>
<p>So I got me a &quot;legged&quot; .25A fuse with a massive voltage rating (I forget what it was, but definitely above
what a mag makes), and hooked it to a regular Molex pin.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">On the tach</p><p>The lead is just a regular pigtailed P-lead, of course. Notice how I like using SCL around individual Molex pins
for added strain relief - that's because I can't produce good Molex crimps that I like; and I end up post-soldering
them in addition to crimping. That strain relief ensures that soldered joint is firmly held immobile. Takes a bit
of extra time, but I actually like that better than straight Molex crimps.</p>
<p>The rest of the front panel wasn't interesting, just annoying. There's only three circuits there: nav lights wires
from the left wing run along the back of the panel to the right side where the conduit is, and then there's hobbs
and tach, and that's it. It was just very annoying: with very little access, not being able to see things,
and, being in the front hole, having to climb out and in every time I needed a tool I forgot to put close (when
in the back hole, I can roll up a cart to it and have all my tools there).</p>
<p>Mirror was absolutely required.</p>

<h2>Firewall Forward</h2>
<p>The final set of wires to join the main harness were all the wires coming from the firewall side - mainly,
transducers and other instrumentation wires, but also a couple wires for the voltage regulator.</p>
<p>This was precisely when I realized the mistake I talked about in the beginning - and ended up with less
neat, and more tortured harness. Oh well.</p>
<p>I started up front, trimming and terminating my fat wires for the starter and alternator B-feed. Some more extreme
soldering (to cap them), this time with a torch.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">More extreme soldering</p><p>I tied up, and clamped the fat bundle to the motor: and apparently, didn't take a single picture.</p>
<p>Then, I had to figure out the diode for the Starter contactor - first of, it needed longer leads. There, instead
of soldering, I used small barrel crimps from Molex along with heatshrink (I do use them where soldering is
impractical, and I decided not to have soldered joints FWF).</p>

cleaner this way.</p>
<p>I <a class="reference external" href="http://79ft.net/entries/2019-06-18-fuselinks/">tested them a while back</a>, and am confident they'll work.</p>
<p>First, we take a wire 4 &quot;gauge steps&quot; thinner than the fused one (so 24GA for 20GA fused, etc). That goes
into the &quot;source&quot; terminal.</p>

them later.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="tail-light">
<h2>Tail Light</h2>
<p>I got rid of the belly strobe on the plane, because it was too heavy and too.. useless. Wingtip lights are gonna be the SkyBeacon
and SkySensor from uAvionix (my ADSB mandate compliance :) ), and they have strobes: but they're not visible from the back. So
I decided to replace the tail nav light with an LED nav/strobe.</p>
<p>Problem number one: no ground wire going to the tail light. For whatever reason, Remo decided to basically use the fact that the
tail light is hooked up to the rudder with a pair of screws thru sheet metal of the rear rudder bow... I don't even want to begin to think what
the ground path would be: hinges? control cables?</p>
<p>So, I needed a second wire.</p>
<p>Problem number two: it had to be one neat cable, and it had to be of a smallish diameter (Remo had an old 20GA wire, which is thicker
than modern 20GA tefzel wire).</p>
<p>I decided to use a chunk of  20GA shielded - same ones I used for p-leads. Technically I guess you're not supposed to do that, but it's
very far from all the antennas and I'm crossing my fingers that it won't create too much problems. Thickness was spot on.</p>
<p>So, I soldered the new piece to the old wire, and fished it thru using old wire as a pull. That part was scary - if that didn't
work, I would've had to cut holes in the rudder to get a new wire thru.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">All hooked up!</p><p>On the other end (on the tail fin side) the wire went into a hole on the inspection cover, and had to join the wire coming from the front.
And I had to have the ground there. You can see that area right behind the elevator on the &quot;fishing wire thru&quot; picture.</p>
<p>Problem number three: <em>nothing</em> to hook up the ground to in that area. The only option I figured out  was to use one of the rivnuts that are
attached to the tabs welded to the frame, hoping that there's no corrosion there between the aluminum rivnut and steel fuselage. I figured I'd
use a way too long a screw thru one of the rivnuts when attaching that inspection cover, and then pull the ring terminal onto it, and secure it
against the back side of the rivnut with a nut and a washer. Ugly? Yes; but I didn't have any more options. Really, the right way to do that
would be to run two wires from the pilot panel all the way back, but.. I'd have to start cutting fabric for that.</p>
<p>So, I attached the positive to the wire that was already there, terminated my ground, hooked everything up, hooked up some power, and...</p>
<p>Nothing.</p>
<p>A bit of debugging showed that... ground was the problem. Damn! I picked the wrong rivnut, I guess - it had corrosion.
The one right on the other side though showed the right voltage when measured against the positive lead, so I just moved everything to the
other side, and...</p>

<p>First, conduit, cockpit side. Lots of crossing things, lots of padding for bowdens where they cross the wires (I used the right
sized vinyl tubing from my local friendly Aerospace Depot, and lacing to tie it).</p>
<p>Engine monitor harness got covered in tube for quite a distance - there was no way to keep it off and not rubbing on the conduit.</p>

money on shipping small-headed #10 screws (the screws in the terminals are #8 but with small &quot;oval&quot; rather than &quot;pan&quot; aviation style head,
so I'd have to get me some decent screws from McMaster.. by the time I'd be done, it'd be close to those $35).</p>

<h2>Switch Anti-Rotation Holes</h2>
<p>You have probably figured by now that I have a taste for misery, and for ranting about how miserable that or this was :). If
you read a <em>few</em> notes in this Dear Diary, you will notice a trend - that I tend to come up with ways  of making myself
aggravated, very consistently and reliably.</p>
<p>Well, this time it was the &quot;anti-rotation&quot; holes for switches in the panel; and the plan was to drill them from
the <em>back side</em> of the panel <em>not quite all the way thru</em> (yay, no access and contortionism again!)</p>
<p>Every switch, circuit breaker, and certainly, a dimmer, comes with a &quot;keyed&quot; washer to prevent it's rotation. That means
you're drilling two holes - one for the appliance (switch, or whatever), and the other for the little tab that's on the
washer.</p>
<p>Picture explains this better. Here is a little hole template I quickly drew in Solidworks, properly dimensioned,
with washers from (left to right) the circuit breaker, switch, and the dimmer.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-09-10-panel-holes-compass/p-2.jpg" title="Holes template" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-09-10-panel-holes-compass/p-2-thumb.jpg" title="Holes template" alt="Holes template" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Holes template</p><p>See, Remo didn't have those &quot;secondary&quot; holes on the panel - so I had to drill them (especially for the dimmer).</p>
<p>But wait, you ask. If you drill holes, that will be ugly - a hole next to every switch?</p>
<p>Yup. Aha. Agreed! Though the nuts are supposed to cover them, they, I'm pretty sure, from my testing at least, wouldn't
have...</p>
<p>No problem! Remo made the panel from 1/8&quot; thick aluminum, and I needed maybe <em>half</em> that much for the tabs to go in. So
the plan was to very carefully drill them just deep enough to house the tabs.</p>
<p>Made me a nice little set of templates...</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-09-10-panel-holes-compass/p-3.jpg" title="Templates in the making" >

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Templates in the making</p><p>...out of a small piece of aluminum, drilled holes using my paper template, and cut them up...</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Templates, cut up</p><p>...and cleaned up the holes and edges.</p>
<p>The plan was, to put a template like a &quot;washer&quot; around a switch/CB/..., and center punch the secondary, small, hole, thru it.
Then, I'll have punch marks to drill, and will have to either get to them from the side of the plane, or, more likely, from the <em>back</em> of
the panel while sitting in the seat and <em>not seeing where they are while drilling</em>, using a mirror to position the drill
first.</p>
<p>Like I said, I have a taste for misery.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Placards - in place</p><p>Wait, wait wait wait. It came <em>off</em>. But it will be held back by the switches' nuts when the switches are in. And.. cover
the holes! That means, I don't need to drill the holes from the back side and worry about punching thru (or not going deep enough) - I can comfortably sit in the cockpit and
drill them from the front! All the way thru! The placard will cover them! In my search for misery, did I luck out?! :)</p>
<p>In retrospect, this (and the opposite side's) placard were probably not glued. No need - switches' nuts hold them just fine.</p>
<p>They were stuck because Remo probably installed them on top of the paint that didn't fully cure - and it just stuck to the backside
of placards over the years, under the pressure from switches' nuts.</p>
<p>I stuck my nail under the opposite side placard, and it came off with a little force.</p>

<p>Looking around, looking around.... aha! Here's a number 8 or 10 screw plugging a hole! I can enlarge it and we'll be
in business! (marked (1)).</p>
<p>Yep. Good luck, buddy. That was an even <em>bigger</em> hole that was plugged with a #8 screw in a countersunk finishing
washer... hmmm... maybe that will work out for the pot too?</p>
<p>You know, drilling a #10 countersunk washer to have a 1/4&quot; hole in it is... hard? Annoying? You can't really grip
it in any manner without damaging it, you can't hold it in your fingers... I think I lucked out on my third try, with combination
of a Unibit and light clamping of that washer in a vice.</p>
<p>With that re-drilled countersunk washer, the pot mounts just fine in hole #2. And #1 got plugged back :).</p>

<h2>Compass Mount</h2>
<p>Well, after all that excitement compass mount was almost anti climactic. I toyed with the idea of putting it into the panel
(and relocating G-meter into a new hole I'd cut around where the ignition switch was - see, after
<a class="reference external" href="http://79ft.net/entries/2019-09-08-fwf-side-channel-panel-layouts/">having failed relocating Hobbs there</a>, the idea of still
making a bigger hole in the panel keeps nagging me :).</p>
<p>No good. When that much down, too much steel around it confuses the compass to the tune of about 30 degrees... No need to
add extra problems in already a magnetically problematic plane.</p>
<p>So, top it was to be. The windshield will get in the way, but I really, really didn't want to take it off (~20 #6
screws and nuts in a tight spot is no fun).</p>
<p>Eyeballed the bracket alignment with the fuselage centerline and put it in the right spot...</p>
<p>Damn! Sharpie's too tall to get in there to mark the holes <em>vertically</em>. &quot;Angle Sharpie Adapter&quot;... hmm..</p>

<hr class="dashed"/><p>I was on the fence about making this entry as multiple separate ones versus just one giant one... After all, it covers
quite a few, mostly unrelated, things that I did in the last few days, and it would've made sense to keep
them separate.</p>
<p>However; finally decided to make just one big article with all of them. None of them are finished; but somewhat a decent
chunk of work is - I think I have <em>mostly</em> figured out where everything will go and how it will all come together.</p>
<p>I guess, what I'm trying to say is, if you clicked on the &quot;Panel Layout&quot; entry in the Log, and are trying to figure out why
are you seeing notes on Firewall Forward, just keep scrolling :).</p>

<h2>Diagram</h2>

<ul class="simple">
<li>Main Connector is gone. I was convinced that reliability concerns outweigh the benefits of having it. Plus, I have very
little precious room to work with.</li>
<li>Physically, it's easier to hook up the LR3C Sense wire to a different spot - on the Shunt stud rather than to the
Master Contactor/Starter Contactor jumper directly. It makes no difference, it's the same circuit - just a different hookup spot to it.</li>
<li>I also fixed some typos, and cleaned up a bit.</li>

<h2>Firewall Forward</h2>
<p>I started trying things around firewall forward while
<a class="reference external" href="http://79ft.net/entries/2019-09-01-carb-cables/">figuring out routing and lengths for carb control cables</a>, and continued
afterwards.</p>
<div class="section" id="contactors-and-beefy-wires">
<h3>Contactors and Beefy Wires</h3>
<div class="section" id="contactors">
<h4>Contactors</h4>
<p>It became obvious fairly quickly that I won't be able to use the nice B&amp;C Starter Contactor because of it's mounting
holes not being the same as a very common SS581 Starter Solenoid that was set up by Remo. Also, the way terminals
were set up on the B&amp;C Starter Contactor would have made them closer to the carb control cables. And, I didn't want to drill more
holes in the firewall.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">SS581 Contactor</p><p>So I decided to go with SS581-style and ordered one from Vans. While waiting for it, I used the old one just to mock
things up.</p>
<p>And because it doesn't have the spike catcher diode, I had to get me a couple IN5400s, and soldered an extension lead to one
of them.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Extension lead</p><p>The other leg will get a crimp ring terminal. I had to do that 'cause the diode leads themselves weren't long enough.</p>

<div class="section" id="battery-and-starter-wires">
<h4>Battery and Starter Wires</h4>
<p>Those are the thickest wires, and routing them is more complicated than the other ones. In addition, the
battery + -&gt; master contactor wire is the only wire that can't be turned off, and therefore needs to be very well
thought out and as short as possible.</p>
<p>Here's something else, too. The Charger was set up to ground the battery to the motor. So far, so good - starter is by far
the largest consumer in the electrical system. However, nothing was done to ground the motor to the rest of the airplane!</p>
<p>So the rest of the system was probably grounded via whatever metal to metal connections there were on the motor.
Control cables and braided fuel and oil hoses? ;) Airbox bowden &quot;carb heat&quot; cable... I can't think of much more else.</p>
<p>Initially, I was planning to run a ground strap braid from the battery negative to one of the bolts holding the battery
box to the firewall, but with fuel system components and control cables around, just couldn't figure out a good way to run
it and support it. I had to end up settling for running it to the engine mount instead.</p>
<p>So the bottom line is, the negative 4GA cable is gonna go to the motor, and parallel to it a braid will go to the motor mount.
I also figured out a clamp arrangement with some standoffs that will keep the wires neat and organized.</p>

That cable turned out to be too short when
relocated - but I lucked out - Glenn had a bowden going to the Rotec TBI that I removed for &quot;prime&quot; function, and that bowden was plenty
long. I'll trim it to final length when I'm done in that side conduit.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Fuse block</p><p>Tight! I basically lose the whole top row of fuses with it. Not enough room....</p>
<p>After poking around the Internets for a bit, came to these nice fuse blocks made by Blue Sea Systems. Longest ones they
have are 8 fuses, so I will need two (if I recall correctly, I have 13 fuses in the diagram currently, and I want some spare
positions for later if I need them).</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Blue Sea Systems fuse block</p><p>Much better! Plus, they use ring terminals rather than tabs - and while tabs are light and simple, I don't like them.
Removing them is hard, and, when removed, the terminal loses a lot of it's grip. It's almost like an &quot;assemble once&quot; type
deal.</p>

<div class="section" id="voltage-regulator">
<h3>Voltage Regulator</h3>
<p>With how the wire harness is gonna go in that conduit, and with bowdens being where they are, the best orientation for the
Voltage Regulator would've been &quot;upside down&quot;, with terminal strip up.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Upside Down orientation</p><p>Damn you, the yellow sticker on the regulator! DAMN you! (hint: read it :) ).</p>
<p>Mounting it sideways, I'd have a line of rivet heads under it - which I didn't want to deal with.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-09-08-fwf-side-channel-panel-layouts/cond-8.jpg" title="Sideways orientation" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-09-08-fwf-side-channel-panel-layouts/cond-8-thumb.jpg" title="Sideways orientation" alt="Sideways orientation" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Sideways orientation</p><p>And mounting it down... Down was annoying because of the clamp for bowdens and bowdens close there. That would also
complicate wiring.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Down orientation</p><p>Upside down would've been perfect... except for that yellow sticker :). So, I decided to Hail Mary and asked nice folks at
B&amp;C about what they thought.</p>
<p>See, the problem is I know why they wanted the terminal strip to be pointed down. It's so that water won't get into the
box in case of condensation accumulating on it. But I thought, maybe I can seal it somehow?</p>
<p>The answer from TJ at B&amp;C was a resounding no. Right side up, sideways - but not upside down.</p>
<p>So I mocked up the right side up mounting...</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-09-08-fwf-side-channel-panel-layouts/cond-12.jpg" title="Right side up mockup" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-09-08-fwf-side-channel-panel-layouts/cond-12-thumb.jpg" title="Right side up mockup" alt="Right side up mockup" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Right side up mockup</p><p>Yuck. Yeah; it'd work; but it's ugly as hell.</p>
<p>The only other option would be sideways, but on &quot;standoffs&quot; of sorts to clear the rivet heads. I mentioned that to TJ, and he
said that that could work, but I should check if I can access the voltage adjustment screw on the top of the box.</p>
<p>Damn it! I forgot about it. On the top of the box there's a plug over a hole that opens up access to a tiny screw to adjust
buss voltage - basically, to fine tune how much volts the battery sees. Not something you do often, but you want to be able
to do it.</p>
<p>But then, TJ mentioned that he saw the holes in the firewall and that might be the saving grace.</p>
<p>Bingo!</p>
<p>I tried it out again in vertical, now with mocked up standoffs</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Vertical</p><p>With just enough aggravation due to bad access (mandatory in aviation pretty much), you can undo the bolt covering the hole
in the firewall (this hole was left over from the brake line relocation), pop the plug on the voltage regulator, and
just have enough access to the adjustment screw.</p>

<h3>Hobbs</h3>
<p>Hobbs was on the front panel, probably because of space issues on the rear panel.</p>

<p>Well, I had this unsightly hole left over after removing the ignition key switch...</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Unsightly hole</p><p>... and I thought, maybe I could put the Hobbs back there?</p>
<p>My initial tests with one of the  2 1/4 gauges I have removed seemed to have been okay: there was <em>just enough</em> room
in there to get another 2 1/4 gauge in.</p>
<p>So, I got me a very nice panel punch that could make a nice, round, clean hole in place.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-09-08-fwf-side-channel-panel-layouts/punch.jpg" title="Instrument Hole Punch" >

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Instrument Hole Punch</p><p>Well, next was to remove the Hobbs from the front panel. <em>That</em> was an hour of contortionism. The Hobbs is
held by an aluminum backplate and
four nylock nuts, so I <em>had</em> to have a wrench over them the <em>whole</em> time. Oh, the screws are way too long BTW, so taking all
them out took about five times more turns than it should've, while I was wondering if my wrists will take this much
flexing, twisting, and bending any longer.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Mounting ring</p><p>This is a pic from the fuel quantity gauge held in the same manner, but here he's using brass flat type nuts that you can
hold with your fingers. On the Hobbs, it was nylocks.</p>
<p>Anyway, I got it out.  And then, started setting up for punching that hole.
Removed VSI to give me a bit more room to work with.</p>
<p>I tried to reconstruct exactly what happened next in my memory to write it down here, and could not.
I was basically fiddling, checking clearances, making sure I'll be able to hook up the punch and center the hole, have
enough room for the mounting ring in the back and clear everything I had to clear, when I discovered that...</p>
<p>The Hobbs was <em>not</em> a standard 2 1/4 inch gauge - it was a touch <em>bigger</em>. So the hole that I would've made would've been
too small for it. And that if I punched the hole, I would've been just left with a bigger hole and nothing to
put in there.</p>
<p>Damn, damn, damn! Damn you, assumptions that every &quot;small&quot; gauge on an airplane is 2 1/4!</p>
<p>And I had the expensive punch that I had no use for :(.</p>
<p>Oh well. Thanks God I actually did <em>not</em> do it - only to have a <em>larger</em> hole to plug up. I guess, that Hobbs is (thru
more contortionism) going back to the front panel.</p>
<p>As they say, Le Sigh.</p>

<h3>Switches</h3>
<p>Finally, something fun! I put in the switches to play with layout. Here's the first, and (after playing with moving things
around and pretend turning them on and off), the <em>best</em>, layout.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Right side</p><p>On the right side, I might clump the switches together, or leave them as on the picture, to &quot;match&quot; the placards (those are
left over placards from fuses that were there in the old electrical system). The little brass knob on the right is gonna
be panel lighting control pot.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="compass">
<h3>Compass</h3>
<p>I am going to replace Pilot's whiskey compass with a vertical card one - yes, I am directionally retarded :) It's not
that expensive a mod in the grand scheme of things; and is the only directional instrument available to pilot on this
plane (no DG ;) ).</p>
<p>It's a bit taller than the whiskey compass, so I'm playing with different mount locations. I think this is what it will be;
with shock isolating rubber pad under the mount where the gap is at the moment.</p>
