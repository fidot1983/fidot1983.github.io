<hr class="dashed"/><p>I was on the fence about making this entry as multiple separate ones versus just one giant one... After all, it covers
quite a few, mostly unrelated, things that I did in the last few days, and it would've made sense to keep
them separate.</p>
<p>However; finally decided to make just one big article with all of them. None of them are finished; but somewhat a decent
chunk of work is - I think I have <em>mostly</em> figured out where everything will go and how it will all come together.</p>
<p>I guess, what I'm trying to say is, if you clicked on the &quot;Panel Layout&quot; entry in the Log, and are trying to figure out why
are you seeing notes on Firewall Forward, just keep scrolling :).</p>
<div class="section" id="diagram">
<h2>Diagram</h2>
<p>I have updated the electrical diagram, version 2 is <a class="reference external" href="/files/6781G-new-electrical/6781G-wiring-diagram.v2.pdf">here</a>.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Main Connector is gone. I was convinced that reliability concerns outweigh the benefits of having it. Plus, I have very
little precious room to work with.</li>
<li>Physically, it's easier to hook up the LR3C Sense wire to a different spot - on the Shunt stud rather than to the
Master Contactor/Starter Contactor jumper directly. It makes no difference, it's the same circuit - just a different hookup spot to it.</li>
<li>I also fixed some typos, and cleaned up a bit.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Firewall Forward</h2>
<p>I started trying things around firewall forward while
<a class="reference external" href="http://79ft.net/entries/2019-09-01-carb-cables/">figuring out routing and lengths for carb control cables</a>, and continued
afterwards.</p>
<div class="section" id="contactors-and-beefy-wires">
<h3>Contactors and Beefy Wires</h3>
<div class="section" id="contactors">
<h4>Contactors</h4>
<p>It became obvious fairly quickly that I won't be able to use the nice B&amp;C Starter Contactor because of it's mounting
holes not being the same as a very common SS581 Starter Solenoid that was set up by Remo. Also, the way terminals
were set up on the B&amp;C Starter Contactor would have made them closer to the carb control cables. And, I didn't want to drill more
holes in the firewall.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">SS581 Contactor</p><p>So I decided to go with SS581-style and ordered one from Vans. While waiting for it, I used the old one just to mock
things up.</p>
<p>And because it doesn't have the spike catcher diode, I had to get me a couple IN5400s, and soldered an extension lead to one
of them.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Extension lead</p><p>The other leg will get a crimp ring terminal. I had to do that 'cause the diode leads themselves weren't long enough.</p>

<div class="section" id="battery-and-starter-wires">
<h4>Battery and Starter Wires</h4>
<p>Those are the thickest wires, and routing them is more complicated than the other ones. In addition, the
battery + -&gt; master contactor wire is the only wire that can't be turned off, and therefore needs to be very well
thought out and as short as possible.</p>
<p>Here's something else, too. The Charger was set up to ground the battery to the motor. So far, so good - starter is by far
the largest consumer in the electrical system. However, nothing was done to ground the motor to the rest of the airplane!</p>
<p>So the rest of the system was probably grounded via whatever metal to metal connections there were on the motor.
Control cables and braided fuel and oil hoses? ;) Airbox bowden &quot;carb heat&quot; cable... I can't think of much more else.</p>
<p>Initially, I was planning to run a ground strap braid from the battery negative to one of the bolts holding the battery
box to the firewall, but with fuel system components and control cables around, just couldn't figure out a good way to run
it and support it. I had to end up settling for running it to the engine mount instead.</p>
<p>So the bottom line is, the negative 4GA cable is gonna go to the motor, and parallel to it a braid will go to the motor mount.
I also figured out a clamp arrangement with some standoffs that will keep the wires neat and organized.</p>

<p>ANLs and the Ammeter Shunt will go to where no man had go... 'cuse me, to where the old Voltage Regulator was. Like this:</p>

that, it would not let the ANL covers to come on. So, before doing anything drastic, I decided to check to see how it
would look with the wire jumpers</p>

<h2>Side Conduit</h2>
<p>The Voltage Regulator and the Main Terminal/Fuse Block were to go to the Side Conduit running alongside the fuselage.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Rough component locations</p><p>I had to relocate the bowdens lower to free up some space.  The Oil Cooler box on this plane is all sorts of weird, including a flapper valve controlled by one of those bowdens that closes up the airflow to it (which is not enough to begin with; being a 1.5&quot; SCAT takeoff off of back baffle.. but don't get me started on that). That cable turned out to be too short when
relocated - but I lucked out - Glenn had a bowden going to the Rotec TBI that I removed for &quot;prime&quot; function, and that bowden was plenty
long. I'll trim it to final length when I'm done in that side conduit.</p>
<p>The brake tube was running inside the conduit, and I will have to relocate it to run below the conduit and be supported
by adel clamps. For now, I unhooked it and used it to somewhat mock up the new run. Tube and fittings ordered,
and tubing bender already here!</p>
<div class="section" id="fuse-block">
<h3>Fuse Block</h3>
<p>I was gonna use a 20-position fuse block from B&amp;C. Well, <em>that</em> didn't go too well.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Fuse block</p><p>Tight! I basically lose the whole top row of fuses with it. Not enough room....</p>
<p>After poking around the Internets for a bit, came to these nice fuse blocks made by Blue Sea Systems. Longest ones they
have are 8 fuses, so I will need two (if I recall correctly, I have 13 fuses in the diagram currently, and I want some spare
positions for later if I need them).</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-09-08-fwf-side-channel-panel-layouts/cond-17.jpg" title="Blue Sea Systems fuse block" >

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Blue Sea Systems fuse block</p><p>Much better! Plus, they use ring terminals rather than tabs - and while tabs are light and simple, I don't like them.
Removing them is hard, and, when removed, the terminal loses a lot of it's grip. It's almost like an &quot;assemble once&quot; type
deal.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="voltage-regulator">
<h3>Voltage Regulator</h3>
<p>With how the wire harness is gonna go in that conduit, and with bowdens being where they are, the best orientation for the
Voltage Regulator would've been &quot;upside down&quot;, with terminal strip up.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Upside Down orientation</p><p>Damn you, the yellow sticker on the regulator! DAMN you! (hint: read it :) ).</p>
<p>Mounting it sideways, I'd have a line of rivet heads under it - which I didn't want to deal with.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Sideways orientation</p><p>And mounting it down... Down was annoying because of the clamp for bowdens and bowdens close there. That would also

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Down orientation</p><p>Upside down would've been perfect... except for that yellow sticker :). So, I decided to Hail Mary and asked nice folks at
B&amp;C about what they thought.</p>
<p>See, the problem is I know why they wanted the terminal strip to be pointed down. It's so that water won't get into the
box in case of condensation accumulating on it. But I thought, maybe I can seal it somehow?</p>
<p>The answer from TJ at B&amp;C was a resounding no. Right side up, sideways - but not upside down.</p>
<p>So I mocked up the right side up mounting...</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-09-08-fwf-side-channel-panel-layouts/cond-12.jpg" title="Right side up mockup" >

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Right side up mockup</p><p>Yuck. Yeah; it'd work; but it's ugly as hell.</p>
<p>The only other option would be sideways, but on &quot;standoffs&quot; of sorts to clear the rivet heads. I mentioned that to TJ, and he
said that that could work, but I should check if I can access the voltage adjustment screw on the top of the box.</p>
<p>Damn it! I forgot about it. On the top of the box there's a plug over a hole that opens up access to a tiny screw to adjust
buss voltage - basically, to fine tune how much volts the battery sees. Not something you do often, but you want to be able
to do it.</p>
<p>But then, TJ mentioned that he saw the holes in the firewall and that might be the saving grace.</p>
<p>Bingo!</p>
<p>I tried it out again in vertical, now with mocked up standoffs</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Vertical</p><p>With just enough aggravation due to bad access (mandatory in aviation pretty much), you can undo the bolt covering the hole
in the firewall (this hole was left over from the brake line relocation), pop the plug on the voltage regulator, and
just have enough access to the adjustment screw.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Unsightly hole</p><p>... and I thought, maybe I could put the Hobbs back there?</p>
<p>My initial tests with one of the  2 1/4 gauges I have removed seemed to have been okay: there was <em>just enough</em> room
in there to get another 2 1/4 gauge in.</p>
<p>So, I got me a very nice panel punch that could make a nice, round, clean hole in place.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Instrument Hole Punch</p><p>Well, next was to remove the Hobbs from the front panel. <em>That</em> was an hour of contortionism. The Hobbs is
held by an aluminum backplate and
four nylock nuts, so I <em>had</em> to have a wrench over them the <em>whole</em> time. Oh, the screws are way too long BTW, so taking all
them out took about five times more turns than it should've, while I was wondering if my wrists will take this much
flexing, twisting, and bending any longer.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Mounting ring</p><p>This is a pic from the fuel quantity gauge held in the same manner, but here he's using brass flat type nuts that you can
hold with your fingers. On the Hobbs, it was nylocks.</p>
<p>Anyway, I got it out.  And then, started setting up for punching that hole.
Removed VSI to give me a bit more room to work with.</p>
<p>I tried to reconstruct exactly what happened next in my memory to write it down here, and could not.
I was basically fiddling, checking clearances, making sure I'll be able to hook up the punch and center the hole, have
enough room for the mounting ring in the back and clear everything I had to clear, when I discovered that...</p>
<p>The Hobbs was <em>not</em> a standard 2 1/4 inch gauge - it was a touch <em>bigger</em>. So the hole that I would've made would've been
too small for it. And that if I punched the hole, I would've been just left with a bigger hole and nothing to
put in there.</p>
<p>Damn, damn, damn! Damn you, assumptions that every &quot;small&quot; gauge on an airplane is 2 1/4!</p>
<p>And I had the expensive punch that I had no use for :(.</p>
<p>Oh well. Thanks God I actually did <em>not</em> do it - only to have a <em>larger</em> hole to plug up. I guess, that Hobbs is (thru
more contortionism) going back to the front panel.</p>

around and pretend turning them on and off), the <em>best</em>, layout.</p>

<h3>Compass</h3>
<p>I am going to replace Pilot's whiskey compass with a vertical card one - yes, I am directionally retarded :) It's not
that expensive a mod in the grand scheme of things; and is the only directional instrument available to pilot on this
plane (no DG ;) ).</p>
<p>It's a bit taller than the whiskey compass, so I'm playing with different mount locations. I think this is what it will be;
with shock isolating rubber pad under the mount where the gap is at the moment.</p>

<hr class="dashed"/><p>Even before Oshkosh, I have decided to replace the Rotec TBI the Charger had when I got it with a good old MA4-SPA carb. In short,
I do not trust the damn thing - especially with it being the sole component providing two out of three vertices
of the proverbial fire triangle to the motor. That reminds me, I need to summarize my thoughts on Rotec...</p>
<p>Regardless, one of the things  I got at Oshkosh was a rebuilt MA4-SPA from Spruce, and it was sitting in the
hangar waiting it's turn. I knew I would need to order new control cables for it, so I decided to get that going, after
all the alternator business was finished, because getting those cables will take me a bit.</p>
<p><em>Here's a fun aside. I knew this motor had a MA4 carb and Glenn &quot;upgraded&quot; it to the Rotec TBI. What I didn't
know was precisely what kind of MA4-SPA it had (and there are quite a few models of that carb).</em></p>
<p><em>No problem. At Oshkosh, I went to nice folks from Tempest (which now owns MA Carbs) and had a very nice conversation with them.
I asked if I should buy the carb from them, and they recommended Spruce instead, because it would be cheaper that way.
And, they mentioned the $600 core charge (I'll spell this out - you must provide a good &quot;core&quot; (old carburetor) or get
charged extra six hundred bucks). Ouch.</em></p>
<p><em>Ha! thought I. I am at Oshkosh! What could be easier than getting an old carburetor, especially since it's one of the
most widespread models? No problem at all!</em></p>
<p><em>Laughing, I ran that by guys from Tempest. They laughed with me, and actually were very very very helpful, telling me
what to look for when picking up an old carb.</em></p>
<p><em>No cracks in the body. Control arms should be present. Threads nice and not torn up. Venturi present. Etc etc etc.</em></p>
<p><em>Well, to the FlyMart we went, and sure enough, on a bench there laid a number of MA4-SPAs present, ranging from
$250 to $450. Of course, I picked up the $250 one (it was yellowtagged by the way! In 1995, if I recall), dragged it
over to Spruce, ordered a new carb, and handed them the old one I just picked up. So, $350 saved in about half a mile
of walking. Not bad!</em></p>
<p>Here it is, in all it's glory, hooked up to my motor. You guys should admire my &quot;economizer design&quot; gasket. Hmm... I need to patent that and start selling them for $100/pop. <em>Your fuel costs will go to 0! Now, you might not be going too far... but..
Fuel costs! Zero! With all the benefits, not going anywhere is such an insig....</em> Ahem.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Carb</p><p>Well, okay. The carb was on, and cables came next.</p>
<p>The Rotec had it's control cables for mixture and throttle done completely differently than the carb. Glenn reused Throttle
cable for Mixture on the TBI - it worked out well. He added a new cable, routed completely differently, for the TBI's
Throttle.</p>
<p>Since this motor was originally carbureted, all I had to do is reverse engineer a bit the way Remo did the hookups.</p>
<p>Hehe.</p>
<p>Well, Throttle on the carb side wasn't that bad.</p>

   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-09-01-carb-cables/c-2-2-thumb.jpg" title="With a Clevis" alt="With a Clevis" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">With a Clevis</p><p>It actually worked out a bit better with a Clevis, having the cable end centered nicely on the throttle arm. So I
decided to do the clevis.</p>
<p>Next was confirming the &quot;throw&quot; - making sure that the throttle control range of motion, whatever it is, is sufficient
(in fact, it must have some extra &quot;padding&quot; in it) to move the throttle stop to stop. Boy, was I in for a treat.</p>
<p>This Charger has <em>reversing</em> throttle quadrants, meaning that when the throttle goes forward,
the actual control is pulled  backward. Since forward on the control must translate into forward on the carburetor, the
Charger has bellcranks to reverse the motion once again. These bellcranks are also a nice spot to tune out the <em>range</em>
of motion.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-09-01-carb-cables/c-3.jpg" title="Control linkage" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-09-01-carb-cables/c-3-thumb.jpg" title="Control linkage" alt="Control linkage" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Control linkage</p><p>See, the relative distance of the top and bottom holes on the bellcrank to it's pivot point &quot;convert&quot; whatever range
of motion is on the control (throttle quadrant) side to an appropriate range of motion on the carburetor side.</p>
<p>And Glenn changed them.</p>
<p>Not a surprise. The Rotec TBI had it's controls set up very differently as compared to a carb. Notice how in the picture
the color of those bellcranks is somewhat off from the rest of the fuselage? That was my first clue...</p>
<p>My second clue was finding one of those bellcrank plates (minus the bearing) in the box of parts that I got with the airplane.</p>
<p>My third clue was me not being able to get the full range on the throttle.</p>
<p>Crap!</p>
<p>I am absolutely not set up to redo the bellcranks. Though they look simple, unless I want to make them from 3/16&quot; steel, which
would make them very, very, VERY heavy, I'd need a TIG welder. Or to MacGyver things with washers. And do quite a lot of
trial and error.</p>
<p>I wanted to see if I could luck out.</p>
<p>Credit goes to Glenn here - he made his new bellcranks <em>perfect</em> for the TBI. The range of motion on them was just right...
for the TBI. Because of that, they were asymmetrical - so I thought; maybe, just <em>maybe</em>, if I was to try them in different
combinations, I would luck out...</p>
<p>And I did!</p>
<p>Now, these two paragraphs of text and one picture is me describing... about 3 or 4 hours of work - tweaking cables,
turning bellcranks, checking, rinsing, and repeating. I think I did find a combination of orientation of these that gave
me <em>acceptable</em> (but by no means perfect) ranges of motion. I think I lost about an inch on both of the controls, but
that's not so bad, after all - you want extra room in your control's range of movement to make absolutely positive
you can move the controlled thing stop to stop.</p>
<p>Okay, Mixture's next.</p>
<p>I hooked up the cable that Glenn used for throttle to the mixture control on the carb, to use as a &quot;mock up&quot;,
and kinda fished it thru.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-09-01-carb-cables/c-1-4.jpg" title="Mixture cable hookup" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-09-01-carb-cables/c-1-4-thumb.jpg" title="Mixture cable hookup" alt="Mixture cable hookup" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Mixture cable hookup</p><p>I had to use a rod end here. The cable wouldn't line up with the control arm on the carb for me to be able to
use a Clevis there.... See how angled and offset that hookup is? I think Remo had a solid bowden cable style control
there...</p>
<p>Another problem with the Mixture control is that the carb's arm has a 1/4&quot; hole.. the rod ends need a #10 screw; which
means that the hole on the carb arm is too large. No biggie though, I'll add a bushing to reduce it.</p>
<p>Yet another problem is that the bolt's head is way too close to the carb bowl, and I had to have it reversed like
that (bolt &quot;upside down&quot;).</p>
<p>There's not a lot of room on the top either. Planning to  fix this problem with using of 1/2
size shear nut, and figuring out the exact bolt length (I ordered every bolt between -4 and -10 sizes).</p>
<p>And now, the routing of those cables.</p>
<p>The throttle cable routing was a given. I did not like too tight a radius in one of it's &quot;turns&quot;.</p>
<p>I wanted to try to optimize the routing..... ha. Good luck there buddy! The battery box gets in the way (the battery is
in a completely wrong place on this plane... it's reversed with the oil cooler. Oil cooler should be on the left. Battery
on the right. This makes controls routing a breeze. But no.....).</p>
<p>I wanted to make sure to keep the mixture cable to not be too close to the beefy 4 AWG cable that will go from
the battery to the master relay.</p>
<p>I had to reverse engineer previous routing of the cable, and figure out the best points to hook it up to the firewall.</p>
<p>I wanted to have my ANL fuse bases close to the master and starter relay. Ha! No way, with the control cables
the way they would have to be.</p>
<p>All this was an exercise in misery, and lots and lots of time. I wanted too much.</p>
<p>In the end, the routing of the throttle will stay the same; the cable will just be shortened to make one of the
turn radiusii bigger. The mixture will go nearby, and curl around the battery box.</p>
<p>I will not be able to use any other arrangement of solenoids and will have to stick to the old one. What's worse,
I will not be able to use the new solenoid I got from B&amp;C - it's mounting holes are very different, and, frankly,
it's not worth it to drill more holes in already a sieve-like firewall - I'll stick with the classic &quot;style&quot;.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Approx. new routing</p><p>The mixture cable does look like it'll interfere with the solenoids, I know. In the final setup, it will be pulled
away from the firewall and clamped to a couple of points I found.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>More bad news? I long noticed a leak from the left brake bleeder valve; and decided to add a new valve to my next order from Spruce.
I thought it was a basic valve problem. Well,  went to look for it's dimensions, and found out the source of the damn
leak, actually... Looks like someone tried to fix a leak there by making a bigger leak. The fun thing was, I didn't notice
this before - the brake was too dirty...</p>

<p>Okay. I'm lying to you. This template is not the one I used. It was done with the long belt that ended up not working out,
so I had to redo the template (thanks God, just the template). The new one was done in the same manner as the one I described
above.</p>
<p>Here it is:</p>

<h2>Solidworks!</h2>
<p>It's magic, I keep telling people.</p>
<p>So, we take our  template, and scan it on a scanner, along with a little metal ruler to give us physical dimensions. Then, we go to Solidworks, start a sketch, and insert the scan as &quot;sketch picture&quot;. Using the image of the ruler <em>that was scanned in</em>, we tell Solidworks what &quot;one inch&quot; on this picture is. Boom! The image is now dimensionally accurate.</p>
<p>Then, we start drawing around it.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Initial sketch</p><p>Above, I positioned the top hole, and the four 5/16&quot; holes around bolt imprints. I then sketched a large circle and made it <em>tangent</em> to three out of four of those holes - it defines the &quot;pivot arc&quot;. Then, offsetting it 5/16th gives me the other &quot;side&quot; of the slot; and offsetting it more gives me the &quot;sides&quot; of the bracket in the &quot;pivot arc&quot; area.</p>
<p>I also started sketching the &quot;no go&quot; lines around the top portion of the bracket.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-08-31-alternator-pivot-arm/b-9.jpg" title="More circles" >

You can almost see the outline of the pivot arm, yes? ;)</p>
<p>Now, we take this master sketch; and add arc elements with real lines that we care about.</p>

<hr class="dashed"/><p>As I have <a class="reference external" href="http://79ft.net/entries/2019-08-16-alternator-fitting/">thought before</a>, I would need the new nose baffle

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Old baffle support bracket</p><p>...because it would have to now be shorter, fitting <em>in front</em> of the new case mount alternator bracket, over
it's right &quot;ear&quot; over here:</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Gap between starter boss and alternator bracket</p><p>See that gap between the starter boss &quot;ear&quot; and the new alternator bracket?</p>
<p>Hmmm, methinks.. Maybe, maybe, I can get away without bending up a new, 0.090 steel bracket with weird geometry (it's
not a simple &quot;couple bends and you're done&quot; - you'll see later).</p>
<p>Well, let's see.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-08-25-alternator-baffle-support-bracket/b-2.jpg" title="Old bracket fits nicely in that gap" >

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Old bracket fits nicely in that gap</p><p>But it was <em>just a touch</em> too &quot;low&quot;. Didn't fit right - and I couldn't raise it (that would raise the holes to which
the nose baffle itself attaches, and make the whole thing just not work).</p>
<p>Oh well, I guess we're bending steel after all.</p>
<p>Around that time, my strip  of 4130 I ordered from Spruce some days back showed up.</p>
<p>I needed a vice, and a couple more pieces of steel for bending block and such. Picked those up at big box stores
(and I will admit, that included a trip to Harbor Freight..).</p>
<p>I also fished out my old small belt sander, and air grinder, from the storage (all my tools are packed up aside
from simple hand tools - I am rebuilding my shop; and thanks God I had them close so that I didn't have to rummage thru boxes).</p>
<p>Cutting off a small chunk of an approx. 1/4&quot; thick strip for a bending block is no joke...</p>

I didn't have anything better to do).</p>
<p>Then, I attempted to get away with shoddy bevel grind on the bending block...</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Very poorly made bending block</p><p>I hoped that that little &quot;cavity&quot; in the middle would work enough to handle bending spring-back - the roundover was fine, just
the bevel was uneven.</p>
<p>Ha! Bending a couple of test bends proved me wrong; and that one never gets away with shoddy workmanship.</p>
<p>I re-ground the block to have a nice, even section (all that on a 1x30 belt sander by the way - which I have discovered is perfectly adequate for handling steel with a ~40 grit belt).</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Edge to be cleaned up</p><p>I kinda gave up on it, frankly - got too tired to get it straight and even; and decided to temporarily switch my mind to something
else.</p>
<p>Instead, I cut another, test strip, of 4130, without making it to proper width - and attempted to replicate the bracket's geometry
on the now much better bending block.</p>
<p>Thinking about how to replicate bend lines, I couldn't think of anything better than... just roughly folding a piece of paper
over the old bracket.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Old bracket, test bend, paper pattern, and strip prepared for the new bracket</p><p>It worked!</p>
<p>The key was, rather than bending the strip over the block by hand, instead, start the bend by hand, and
then finish it with the hammer. I used another piece of 1/4 strip that I cleaned up as an &quot;interface&quot; between the hammer and
the material bent, to avoid hammer marks. This way, the bend was much tighter radius (equal to about material thickness, which is what you need for steel), and much easier to control and nudge in the proper direction.</p>
<p>The geometry of the bracket was close enough; the angles were off a bit, but those could be tweaked.</p>
<p>All that bending was one day. I felt done, and left.</p>
<p>Next time I was over at the hangar, I thought, &quot;to hell with it&quot;, and decided to use my real strip that I cut out for final bracket.</p>
<p>Used a nice square to draw a reference line, and cleaned up and straightened that edge left  over from cutting, marked the first bend line using the paper template left over from my test bend:</p>

Golden Lindy ;) ).</p>
<p>I guess I'm keeping mine.</p>
<p>I pulled out my nice Cobalt bits I got at Oshkosh to make those holes. At that point I have obtained an old small drill
press for the hangar (I had to drill the first, large, hole in the &quot;ear&quot; free hand - even with Unibit that was very annoying).</p>

<p>By the way - you must say - but it's just two bends! How come your holes are not lining up nicely, and such?</p>
<p>Well, this thing has a very messed up geometry. It's two bends, at a non-even angle. This picture probably illustrates this best:</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Geometry</p><p>Meanwhile, I also had to figure out the alternator's belt length - to make sure it clears all the brackets, and holes in the
nose baffle.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://79ft.net/entries/2019-08-16-alternator-fitting/">I wrote a bit about it in the previous post</a>. Initially I thought that
just mocking up the belt, measuring the length of the mockup, and ordering the right size would work - ha!</p>
<p>New belt was too long, and didn't clear the newly made bracket.</p>
<p>Ooookay. Well, I had the belt that's too long (the one I ordered after making the mockup of belt length with a chunk of wire).
And, I had the belt that was too short (the one that came with the alternator).</p>
<p>So, I bought <em>all the sizes in between</em>.</p>

<p>... and just to make sure that everything will fit with the new bracket, I ended up putting the nosebowl back on. Didn't want
to discover that the nose baffle  was sticking out, or not fitting in any other way, when putting the cowling back on.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">The better way - bracket attach bolts!</p><p>Aha! This is case mount, and the bracket is attached to the motor case. Let's see... Yep! It came off.</p>

the bracket flexing left and right. It lines up great, but, problem number one (but I knew this one), the old
alternator bracket didn't have that. Remo used that hole on the starter boss to hook up the front of the nose &quot;ramp&quot; part of
the baffle:</p>

between this baffle attach bracket, and the starter boss. Material already ordered!</p>
<p>Now, let's test fit the belt, and the new pivot arm. The belt, the belt.. oh wait. Yep. The prop needs to come off - but this
is a non-event now (and I am not leaving the prop off again -
<a class="reference external" href="http://79ft.net/entries/2019-05-17-race-for-the-engine/">learned that one already</a>). I'm becoming quite good at

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Pivot arm</p><p>That black bracket to the left of it holds the hose &quot;ramp&quot; portion of the baffle..... and, it won't let the damn pivot
arm go in! No way. And no easy modification here - it's interfering, seriously...</p>
<p>Frankly, at that point I went home (this whole note covers quite a few days of work), with thoughts of remaking the
front baffle; and spent the evening researching how baffles are done on planes with similar nosebowl... Frankly,
I don't like how this front baffle is done on this plane (see
<a class="reference external" href="http://79ft.net/entries/2019-05-17-cowling-conundrum/">Cowling Conundrum</a>), and thought of this as being a good
chance to fix it. I moaned about this to my buddy and colleague Dima D (who's helping me here quite a lot with notes
and advice)...</p>
<p>But next nite, I thought that maybe I can get away with remaking just the arm... I am absolutely not set up to do complicated
sheet metal work at the moment...</p>
<p>The old alternator had this weird pivot arm that now made way more sense. It &quot;doglegged&quot; around the bracket with which
the standard pivot arm interfered:</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">The old pivot arm</p><p>Notice how it has this portion that goes down, and then the pivot arm &quot;turns&quot; left to go under the nose baffle ramp attach
bracket?</p>
<p>That corner is definitely a large stress riser... but this arm held a much heavier Delco-Remy alternator for almost 40 years...
Granted, it's made out of 0.190 steel as opposed to 0.125 steel used in B&amp;C bracket... but I can make a similar one for
the new alternator...</p>
<p>We'll see if we can smooth out that corner so that it's arcing better, reducing stress. If I can, I will use 0.125 steel.
If I can't, I'll settle with 0.190 - just like the old one. We know this works.</p>
<p>Thanks Dima! You were right. For now. I will redo this nose ramp when I'm redoing the motor, later :).</p>
<p>... and now, to the belt. Let's get this nose ramp back on. It has an opening for the belt to pass thru, and a fairing
for the alternator pulley....</p>
<p>Damn. Yep. That one doesn't fit right, either.</p>

It has to go right, which means the alternator has to go down, which means longer belt.</p>

<p>So, where are we at?</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>I will need a new, smaller, bracket for the front support of that nose baffle ramp (the bracket will attach to the starter, same place as before)</li>
<li>I will need to design and make a new pivot arm - and to learn how to make nice slots with hand tools</li>
<li>A different belt</li>

<p>Meanwhile, folks at B&amp;C were extremely helpful and generous with their time, reading my long, ranty, emails, and responding
to me with their thoughts. I really appreciated that!</p>

<hr class="dashed"/><p>So this was quite an effort - not because it was a sophisticated design, but rather because it took quite a bit of time
to lay out in a reasonable fashion...</p>
<p>Oh, and also, somewhere in between I had a break for Oshkosh and a work trip :).</p>
<p>I decided to post this in a form of design notes, so that I can go around asking people what they think...</p>
<div class="section" id="the-new-wiring-diagram">
<h2>The New Wiring Diagram</h2>
<p>I have posted it <a class="reference external" href="/files/6781G-new-electrical/6781G-wiring-diagram.pdf">in PDF over here</a>.</p>
<p>Wire length / drop / load calculations are in the <a class="reference external" href="/files/6781G-new-electrical/6781G-wiring-load-schedule.xlsx">Excel spreadhseet over here</a>.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The design is based on Figure Z-11 from AeroElectric Connection by Bob Nuckolls, with the following tweaks:<ul>
<li>I'm using the B&amp;C LR3C Voltage Regulator, so it's wiring has been incorporated</li>
<li>I dropped the Endurance and Main Battery busses</li>
<li>I have tweaked the starting switches circuit, main buss feeder, and how ammeter is hooked up - see below for discussion</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The diagram is laid out to generally clump the components together as they would be on the airplane. It initially might seem
convoluted - but it has a certain flow to it matching the locations of components. Start in bottom right corner for
battery/starter/alternator circuitry and go counter clockwise - this will effectively take you &quot;thru the airplane&quot; as
the components will be laid out; roughly</li>
</ul>

<div class="section" id="review-items-and-commentary-on-specifics">
<h2>Review Items and Commentary on Specifics</h2>
<div class="section" id="starter-circuitry">
<h3>Starter Circuitry</h3>
<p>My current take on my Starter and Mags circuitry is this:</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-08-11-design-v1/starting-circuit.gif" title="Starting and Mags Circuit" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-08-11-design-v1/starting-circuit.gif" title="Starting and Mags Circuit" alt="Starting and Mags Circuit" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Starting and Mags Circuit</p><p>This is a deviation from Z-11, with both switches having to be in the momentary up position for starter to engage. I like
this better for two reasons:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>It makes the act of starting the motor more explicit</li>
<li>It returns back to correct &quot;running&quot; position automatically</li>
</ul>
<p>I need to test the ergonomics of pressing up a couple switches together. If I don't like it, another alternative would be
to replace the &quot;Right Mag&quot; switch circuitry from -5 to -1: making the top position on it non-momentary (as noted on the diagram).
This will reduce the &quot;user-friendliness&quot; but will still keep the explicitness, especially with my using pull-to-unlock switches
from Honeywell.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="main-power-distribution">
<h3>Main Power Distribution</h3>
<p>The Charging and Buss circuitry excerpt below:</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-08-11-design-v1/power-distribution.gif" title="Power Distribution" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-08-11-design-v1/power-distribution.gif" title="Power Distribution" alt="Power Distribution" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Power Distribution</p><p>Note that:</p>
<p>Shunt is set up to be in the &quot;battery&quot; lead. I like &quot;battery lead&quot; style ammeters, showing charge current on the 12-o-clock-plus
segment, and discharge current on the 12-o-clock-minus segment.</p>
<p>Note that the buss feeder wire is protected by a slow-burn 35A current limiter. In Z-11, that wire is not protected at all. My
reasoning for this decision is that this wire is relatively long on my plane (around 4 feet), since fuse block is near the
rear cockpit. I wanted to protect it.</p>
<p>One area of concern here is that in the event of alternator short, the Ammeter Shunt will be a part of the alternator circuit that
will see a lot of current while the 40A slow burn opens up. My gutfeel says it should be able to handle it, but I am not sure. At
any rate, figure Z-11 has the same setup with shunt on the alternator's B-Lead.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="voltage-regulator-sense-wire">
<h3>Voltage Regulator Sense Wire</h3>
<p>LR3C Voltage Regulator needs a separate &quot;voltage sense&quot; wire that one would normally connect to the main buss. Since the
regulator in my case is closer to the firewall than to the buss (fuse) block, I am connecting it to the main battery
circuitry (jumper wire between Starter and Master contactors). This is somewhat a shorter run and seems that it will be
more logical to measure as close to the battery as possible (especially since I'm saving on wire lengths this way).
Seems sensible to me.</p>
<p>The sense wire will be 20 AWG, about 3' long, and connected via 24 AWG fuselink.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="voltage-regulator-field-supply-circuit">
<h3>Voltage Regulator Field Supply Circuit</h3>
<p>The circuit looks like this:</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-08-11-design-v1/field-supply.gif" title="Field Supply Circuit" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-08-11-design-v1/field-supply.gif" title="Field Supply Circuit" alt="Field Supply Circuit" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Field Supply Circuit</p><p>I copied the AeroElectric's figure Z-11 wire gauges here. In Z-11, everything upstream of Breaker is 18 AWG, and everything
downstream is 20 AWG, but it's not explained why.</p>
<p>Is this driven by a requirement to ensure that fuselink survives the short in the circuit in case of crowbaring, and the
breaker pops first, w/o endangering the fuselink much (18 AWG allows for 22 AWG fuselink instead of 24 AWG)?</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="components-location-and-main-connector">
<h3>Components Location and Main Connector</h3>
<p>Here's a relative diagram of components location, that is necessary for explaining what Main Connector is. Click it for larger
version.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-08-11-design-v1/component-locations.jpg" title="Key component locations" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-08-11-design-v1/component-locations-thumb.jpg" title="Key component locations" alt="Key component locations" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Key component locations</p><p>Note that logically, the way one would wire this airplane would be to pre-wire switches and other items that go into the
pilot's (back) instrument panel with long pigtails, then install the switches, and tie down wiring behind the panel. Then,
the pigtails can be connected to fuse block and loads.</p>
<p>Some of the load wires already exist (lighting for example), and they will have to be spliced to wires coming from switches.</p>
<p>I have decided instead to locate a kind of &quot;Main Connector&quot;  right there near the Fuse
Block. A wire comes off of the Fuse Block, goes to the switch on the panel, then switched power
is returned to the &quot;Main Connector&quot;. Load is on the other side of Main Connector.</p>
<p>This serves a couple purposes:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Create a logical &quot;access point&quot; into the main wire bundle, for reading labels, tracing wires later, and such</li>
<li>Simplify installation process</li>
<li>Connect to existing load wires that are not being replaced</li>
</ul>
<p>For now, I am thinking about using Molex 0.093 pins in two housings (I have 13 circuits total to connect via this thing,
and want to have room for further expansion). I would love suggestions here. One of the requirements is that it should be
easily workable with a multimeter for tracing / testing purposes (I technically could've used  D-Sub here , but am
not due to this precise reason).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="separate-switch-for-turn-and-bank">
<h3>Separate Switch for Turn and Bank</h3>
<p>Yes, it's weird to have that. The original electrical had it. I guess, the logic was to be able to shed half an amp
of unnecessary load in the event of alternator failure, or it was just done for no good reason.</p>
<p>I'm keeping it :).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="front-panel-tach">
<h3>Front Panel Tach</h3>
<p>It's a <a class="reference external" href="http://www.westach.com/instructions/Y2AT3-2.jpg">Westach gauge</a> that feeds off of a magneto P-Lead.
No separate power going to it.</p>
<p>Westach asks for a 1/4 A inline fuse. But why? Seems unnecessary (we don't need to fuse P-Leads).</p>
<p>Wire going to this tach in my opinion need to be shielded P-Lead wire. Not sure if I'm correct here.</p>
<p>I need to tie into one of the P-Leads. I have three options:</p>
<p><strong>At magneto</strong>: I will effectively have two P-Leads coming off of one of them. I have Bendix mags, and connectors on those
might make the whole hookup look ugly. Adds extra wire.</p>
<p><strong>At mag switch in the rear panel</strong>: just adds extra ~4 feet of wire for no reason.</p>
<p><strong>Y-Split the P-lead as it goes along the fuselage</strong>: this seems the most optimal wire-management wise, but I am not sure if
splicing into a P-lead is kosher. I don't see any good reasons why that would be bad, but I don't know everything.
This will likely be a soldered splice unless I find or someone suggests something better. This is my solution of choice at the
moment.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="panel-lighting">
<h3>Panel Lighting</h3>
<p>I am on the fence on this one. On one hand, I can add a nice LED strip light and dimmer to light the panel up.</p>
<p>On the other hand, this is extra weight, and &quot;this is a biplane! you won't fly it at night!&quot; vs. &quot;well what if you find
yourself out late&quot; keeps nagging me. Note: I do <em>not</em> have a landing light (though in a biplane... that's somewhat
a non-necessity ;) ).</p>
<p>I am leaning towards doing it, because doing it now will be easy, and I will have the option to see my gauges at night, even
if that Dark and Stormy Night will be a result of bad planning rather than an intentional thing.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="awg-feeder-for-radios">
<h3>10 AWG Feeder for Radios</h3>
<p>Radio stack was wired via the &quot;Radio Master&quot; switch prior. I was initially going to run separate power feeds to each of the
things in the radio stack, but to get to it, I'll need to pull the wings off (yeah...). It's in between pilot's legs attached
to the bottom of the cockpit.</p>
<p>So, the feeder is staying. The stack has been wired by previous owner recently, and isn't wired badly - with individual fuses
for each radio, and a 10 AWG feeder to it and ground &quot;return&quot; from it.</p>
<p>I'm just putting this &quot;hose&quot; on a 30A fuse, which is more than enough to protect the wire and support all the loads from that
stack.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="strobe-and-nav-on-the-same-circuit">
<h3>Strobe and Nav on the Same Circuit</h3>
<p>I am replacing (TailNav, WingNav) + (old heavy strobe on belly) with <a class="reference external" href="https://uavionix.com/products/skybeacon/">SkyBeacon</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://uavionix.com/products/skysensor/">SkySensor</a> on wingtips and nav/strobe on the tail, but I don't have enough
wiring in the fuselage and wings to have a separate circuit for  strobes. I do not plan to fly IFR (biplane!) so &quot;strobes in
the clouds&quot; is not really an issue. When I will have the rag off the airplane, I will add a separate switching circuit
for just the strobes.</p>

<hr class="dashed"/><p>Finally, doing some actual work on the airplane, and having fun! And I decided to start logging time.. because, why not!</p>
<div class="section" id="wire-marking">
<h2>Wire Marking</h2>
<p>I like marked wires. I used to be a networking guy, and I was very meticulous about marking every single wire in my cabinets, so that I knew
exactly what was plugged in where.</p>
<p>It took a bit of upfront time, but saved a bunch of it later on.</p>
<p>So naturally, I was planning to do the same on the Charger, and, more importantly, make it look <em>professional</em>.</p>
<p>Thanks to living in this day and age, that is simple. No, I'm not gonna pay someone to laser etch my wires - that's a cop out :). It's like
paying someone to paint your plane.</p>
<p>Instead, I have researched and found a perfect label maker - Brady BMP21 (not including a link here because it will probably go dead after
some time... just search for it). This thing has 3:1 heatshrink tube cartridges.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Shrunk!</p></div>
<div class="section" id="fusible-links">
<h2>Fusible Links</h2>
<p>Every wire must be fused at the source. Well, almost every :). We don't fuse a couple wires like battery - master contactor: but this is
an exception rather than the rule.</p>
<p>Most wires are fused on the fuse block at the main buss. But some wires are impractical or impossible to have hooked up to that. Think ammeter
shunt wires as a classic example.</p>
<p>For those, most people use bulky, ugly, and generally eww-y inline fuses. But there's a better option! Enter fusible links.</p>
<p>The idea is simple: use a short length of wire 4 gauges smaller the wire to be fused. So if your wire to be fused is 20AWG, you would do:</p>
<p>Source -&gt; 24AWG -&gt; 20AWG where the 24AWG segment acts as a fuse. The idea is, in case of a short, that piece will burn first.</p>
<p>So, I wanted to convince myself that that will work fine for me.</p>
<p>Initially, me and my ham neighbor tried to use his ~30 amp power supply to do it. No joy. The best we could do is 22 amps, and (imagine that!) 24
gauge we were trying to burn held up to the abuse with no sweat at all! I could even hold it in my fingers. Yay, milspec wire!</p>
<p>So I decided to go rough. I do have a discarded old  battery, after all. It was time to burn some wires with it.</p>
<p>Here, the red wire is 20AWG, and the black wire is 24AWG. Using crimps for quick setup.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Boom!</p><p>It burnt real quick, in less than a second, and the protected (red) wire barely got hot (I was holding it - that was a part of the test). Yes, say
that I am unscientific all you want - milspec wire holds up to 150C, and I can't hold up to 150C. The 20GA wire got barely warm - which means it
won't cause any problems in a bundle.</p>
<p>It worked!</p>
<p>Now, it was time to set up a real one - to make sure that when the &quot;fuse&quot; wire burns, it doesn't damage anything.</p>
<p>B&amp;C sells very nice fiberglass tubing covered in silicone for exactly this purpose.</p>
<p>I also soldered the fuselink in this time - I wanted to see how well will the solder splices hold to the temps.</p>

<p>I took it off to inspect.</p>

<p>I will need to play with different sizes of heatshrink and probably will use the glue lined strain relief kind just to support everything well, but
hey - this worked very well indeed!</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="load-measurements">
<h2>Load Measurements</h2>
<p>Prior to ripping the old wiring out, I wanted to take some real life load measurements with various things turned on,
so that I don't get any nasty surprises.</p>
<p>But this plane has no ammeter... damn. I searched around, and found this little doodad:</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-06-18-fuselinks/hamm.jpg" title="Hall Effect ammeter" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-06-18-fuselinks/hamm-thumb.jpg" title="Hall Effect ammeter" alt="Hall Effect ammeter" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Hall Effect ammeter</p><p>Very nice. It basically measures current on the wire passing thru this big white ring using Hall effect. Very cool! No need to splice into
the battery leads and install a temp shunt.</p>
<p>So, I rigged it up and took some numbers.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-06-18-fuselinks/amm-1.jpg" title="Rigged up" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-06-18-fuselinks/amm-1-thumb.jpg" title="Rigged up" alt="Rigged up" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Rigged up</p><ul class="simple">
<li>Master On: 1.5 amps<ul>
<li>Includes: Master Solenoid, and a couple of gauges</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Fuel Pump: 0.2 amps</li>
<li>&quot;Radios&quot; switch (turns on engine monitor, and power to radios: turning backlighting on them): 0.8 amps</li>
<li>I-Com Radio, Transmit: 2.6 amps</li>
<li>Intercom: 0.1 amps</li>
<li>Transponder: 1.1 amps</li>
<li>Smoke Oil pump: 2.2 - 2.6 amps (high on startup)</li>
</ul>
<p>So couple interesting things here. I think the x-der number is too low, but it wasn't being interrogated, and I can't make it be interrogated
without flying the plane or using a transponder tester which I don't have. Also, Master On is too high seemingly...
Will need to double check later and isolate things (master solenoid, hobbs, voltmeter, voltage regulator, fuel gauge) if I care enough - I don't
think I do. Also, fuel pump is too low seemingly. Need to double-check the spec.</p>
<p>And then, I could not turn on the Turn-Slip Indicator...</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="turn-slip-indicator">
<h2>Turn-Slip Indicator</h2>
<p>Sad, sad indicator... see, it's <em>long</em>. And it's wire connector is sticking out. And it's right behind the front seat's headrest, and there's
just not enough room for it, and the connector.</p>
<p>So whomever put it in... did this:</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-06-18-fuselinks/ts-1.jpg" title="Sad, sad wiring" >

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Sad, sad wiring</p><p>It's hard to see; but basically, those wires are bent &quot;down&quot; at a very sharp 90 degrees angle. Notice how he just used pins without the
actual connector. The distance between them is tiny! I am surprised they haven't shorted over all these years. I really am.</p>
<p>Initially, I thought the gauge didn't turn on because that wiring was all bust up, so to test it, I decided to pull it out.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-06-18-fuselinks/ts-2.jpg" title="On the bench" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-06-18-fuselinks/ts-2-thumb.jpg" title="On the bench" alt="On the bench" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">On the bench</p><p>I cut off the wires with those pins on them to hook it up to my testing battery... hmm.. but I needed some leads! Well, I was gonna
make a bunch of various test leads - so this is as good a time as any! Man, I love soldering...</p>
<p>I long decided to make a bunch of leads with &quot;passthru&quot; banana plugs on one end, and something (a crocodile clamp, a battery clamp,
a ring terminal) on the other. This way, I could mix and match, and plug them into my multimeter; daisy chain, and have multiples
depending on what and how I needed to hook up. I had all the bits (clamps, crocodiles, banana plugs), and even got a roll of very nice super
flexible silicone coated probe wire.</p>

<p>But I had resistance between + and -. And I had voltage! Hmmm..</p>
<p>Second time I hooked it up, I saw a bit of a spark when I put the positive clamp to the battery, and heard something.</p>
<p>I spun the gyro with my finger.... it spun up!</p>
<p>Well, well. So that gyro &quot;froze&quot; in a bit... Yep, it was hard to turn over with a finger - no doubt a small motor in there had a hard time!</p>
<p>I probably &quot;cleared it up&quot; a bit when turning it over with my fingers - but that won't last long... damn.</p>
<p>Are we looking at the overhaul for this thing too now? Sigh.... Maybe I can find parts
to do that myself, but not so sure about that.... It's not common for owners to overhaul their instruments - they're precision clockwork, after
all...</p>
<p>Oh well.</p>
<p>And I will have to figure out how to solve that wiring problem with no space to hook up the right type connector. I am thinking along the
lines of maybe routing a wire from inside of the gauge down thru a hole I'd drill, a grommet it it, and covering the whole business with
with some sealant or something, so that the dust doesn't get in. we'll see. Need to ponder this a bit more.</p>

<hr class="dashed"/><p>So after <a class="reference external" href="http://79ft.net/entries/2019-05-16-fire-hazard/">having discovered the electrical mess</a>, I realized that she's gonna be sitting

<p>Pickle time! Damn, this pickling thing is becoming a thing, excuse my tautologies...</p>
<p>I had to put her together enough to be able to run the engine to circulate and

<p>Let me explain.</p>
<p>Fuel goes into gascolator. Then it branches: one branch goes to the engine driven pump, the other goes to the electric pump. Then, they go to the regulator on the TBI. Then, a couple of 90 degree fittings feed it into the TBI's inlet port, which has the &quot;last chance&quot; screen in it.</p>
<p>That's the port here, right above the airflow straightener:</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-05-17-race-for-the-engine/p-1.jpg" title="TBI from the down low" >

 </a> <p class="small text-center">TBI from the down low</p><p>See that white gunk? That's Teflon dope. &quot;Aircraft grade&quot;; whatever.</p>
<p>Here's the problem.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-05-17-race-for-the-engine/p-4.jpg" title="TBI inlet hole" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-05-17-race-for-the-engine/p-4-thumb.jpg" title="TBI inlet hole" alt="TBI inlet hole" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">TBI inlet hole</p><p>Fuel has to go there, into that inlet hole. That's what the screen fitting screws into. Right past that, inside the TBI itself, there's a turn, another turn, and
a spray bar that sprays gas into the intake, injection-style, thru a tube
with a bunch of tiny holes. That's why there are screens in the fuel system:
to prevent gunk from clogging up those tiny holes.</p>
<p>So now, what happens when you take a <em>male</em> fitting out of a <em>female</em> threaded hole, and the fitting was doped? Some of that stuff ends up on the female portion. Next time the fitting is put in, dope remnants will be pushed in past the engaged threads, and possibly clog up the works.</p>
<p>Not. Good. At. All.</p>
<p>That's why there is the copper crush gasket behind that screen fitting - to seal it to the TBI body w/o requiring anything extra. You can kinda see that gasket all
smudged around with that dope on the first picture.</p>
<p>So I had to deal with it.. Clean it out somehow.</p>
<p>It was crumbly, but sticky enough to not want to come out.</p>
<p>I tried every solvent on hand. Nope.</p>
<p>I tried carefully scraping it out with a dental probe. Yeah, kinda worked,
but I wasn't satisfied.</p>
<p>I tried every solvent in my buddy Dick's hangar. Nope.</p>
<p>In desperation, I drove to the local Home.. strike that, Aerospace, Depot, thinking
about picking up every kind of solvent they had and I didn't.</p>
<p>And then, I remembered this:</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-05-17-race-for-the-engine/p-3.jpg" title="Goof-OFF!" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-05-17-race-for-the-engine/p-3-thumb.jpg" title="Goof-OFF!" alt="Goof-OFF!" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Goof-OFF!</p><p>I don't know what kind of concoction that is; but it worked! The hole was clean.
Next time was a couple days after, and when I got back to the hangar, I discovered that it has turned into a lake :(</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-05-17-race-for-the-engine/p-7.jpg" title="Lake in my hangar" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-05-17-race-for-the-engine/p-7-thumb.jpg" title="Lake in my hangar" alt="Lake in my hangar" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Lake in my hangar</p><p>Grading's all screwed up around our hangars, and when we get lots and lots of
rain, they flood. Not too much though, luckily. This was the second time in
the past few weeks - first time, I had my tools scattered around the floor.
This time, I was smarter...</p>
<p>Anyway, back to the TBI. The rest of it went together quite nicely. I discovered
that there was TorqueSeal put on the idle mixture screw.</p>
<p>Why? No idea. That screw is spring loaded. Should stay put.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-05-17-race-for-the-engine/p-6.jpg" title="Torque Seal where there should be none" >

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Torque Seal where there should be none</p><p>I wanted to flush the lines and then the TBI to make absolutely sure
none of that dope went it. The best way to do that would be with the electrical
pump; but I'm a one man show.... and the switch for it is 5 feet away from the
firewall.</p>
<p>So, I had to rig me up a little doodad.</p>

<p>I borescoped the engine (looked alright - I'll post a report about this later,

 </a> <p class="small text-center">A recipe for a mess...</p><p>After filling the sump up, it was time to check for oil pressure. Lycoming
tells you in SB1241C  to pre-oil your engine by cranking with the starter in
10-30 second bursts until oil pressure comes up to 20 PSI.</p>
<p>Well, oil pressure gauge on the Charger is finicky, so I wanted it to at least
move.</p>
<p>Oh wait. She has an ignition/start switch. No way I can use that to crank and
not have a hot mag w/o messing with P-Leads.</p>
<p>Crap.</p>
<p>Also, I might want to crank from around the firewall (the prop was still off).</p>
<p>But I had my pushbutton doodad!</p>
<p>So I rigged it up to the starter solenoid this time.</p>
<p>Of course I misunderstood the way the starter solenoid was wired.</p>
<p>It had two terminals.</p>
<p>I thought one of them was ground; with the wire going to the firewall.
The other then was supposed to be positive.</p>
<p>That didn't work.</p>
<p>I measured it - between those terminals - nothing. &quot;Dead starter solenoid&quot;,
I though. Crap! It was 8pm. Auto parts stores were closing soon.</p>
<p>I rushed to a nearby O'Reilly. Picked up a starter solenoid. Went back.</p>
<p>Measured it too. NOTHING? How come? Something was amiss.</p>
<p>Only then I started suspecting that something was off. That other terminal on
the original starter solenoid I was hooking my positive wire to was all
corroded and looked like it never had a nut.</p>
<p>OH! The way it's supposed to be wired is that positive goes to the <em>same</em>
terminal where that wire I thought to have been ground was. It wasn't a
ground wire - it was a <em>diode</em>. And the ground was off of the case of the
solenoid.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So, we're cranking now.</p>
<p>30 seconds. No pressure.
30 more. No pressure. Crap!</p>
<p>I unhooked the oil pressure sending hose (the one that hooks up to the line
that goes to the gauge).</p>
<p>Crank. No oil. A couple bubbles is all I got.</p>
<p>CRAP!</p>
<p>The oil pump de-primed itself?</p>
<p>Kinda makes sense I guess? The plane was sitting for way too long :(</p>
<p>So, I took off the oil cooler return line. Dumped another quart of oil in there.</p>
<p>I had this hose fitting that goes on top of an oil bottle that was very neatly
set up to mate with the engine oil hose's flare: so I could squeeze the bottle and push the oil in.</p>
<p>After the whole quart, I re-hooked the line back onto the oil cooler, and tried
again.</p>
<p>Success! Now, I saw oil coming out of the oil pressure sending hose.</p>
<p>Hooked it up to the gauge line, and saw the gauge move, finally. Good.</p>
<p>Damn, with all that cranking I ran out my old battery I had put in there.</p>
<p>Now, have to flip the battery (to put in the good one - the flying one - I always use my old battery from the Cheetah when I mess with electrical, not to abuse the actual &quot;production&quot; battery).</p>
<p>Now, the top spark plugs go back in, the ignition wires get hooked up.</p>
<p>Prop time!</p>
<p>Bolt one - start it in.
Bolt two.
Bolt three.</p>
<p>Bolt 4. Doesn't go in? Not even a chance? What the hell?</p>
<p>I pulled the prop back off and laid it down. Put the front crush plate on top
(that one positions the bolts).</p>
<p>No matter what I did, there'd be at least 3 out of 6 bolts that won't go in.
This time, it was a few dry days, and I guess the prop moved enough to
have the &quot;top&quot; and &quot;bottom&quot; holes (if looking at the prop horizontally) move
closer together. It was off by almost a 1/16th.</p>
<p>So here I was. With an engine that was cranked for a total of a few minutes,
and probably had scraped a lot of oil off of cam lobes and lifters.</p>
<p>With a prop.</p>
<p>I couldn't put on.</p>
<p>Which I needed.</p>
<p>To fire the damn thing up.</p>
<p>It was late. I tidied up, and went home.</p>

<h2>The Prop</h2>
<p>I wrote a note to Frank Johnson who made the prop that same night, and called him the next day.</p>
<p>He wasn't surprised. &quot;Redrill&quot; is a simple fix.</p>
<p>But I was a bit apprehensive, and this was a nice excuse to meet him. He's
2 hours away from me. We agreed to meet in a few days, at the first time
he was available.</p>
<p>So, the engine with oil scraped off the lobes had to sit for another couple
days.</p>

<hr class="dashed"/><p>This thing nagged me for a while. The Charger did not have the Field breaker.
For that matter, it didn't have the Alternator master breaker, either.</p>
<p>It had this weird &quot;main buss&quot; breaker for 60 amps, but that didn't look
like the Alternator breaker to me.</p>
<p>So in between dealing with other things after having decided to
put her thru <a class="reference external" href="/category/chickenhouse-charger2019-annual.html">Annual in 2019</a>
a bit early, I was running around with my multimeter, tracing wires.</p>
<p>Initially, I quickly discovered that some lines were definitely not fused;
like Battery -&gt; Main Buss line, and thought I'd put inline fuses
into them, and be done.</p>
<p>She has an old charging system; a <em>mechanical</em> switching voltage regulator, and
a Delco Remy alternator seemingly from a tractor:</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-05-16-fire-hazard/fh-1.jpg" title="The old Delco-Remy" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-05-16-fire-hazard/fh-1-thumb.jpg" title="The old Delco-Remy" alt="The old Delco-Remy" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">The old Delco-Remy</p><p>Voltage regulator didn't make sense. It had 4 wires (should be 2: supply and
field output, or 3: supply, sense, and field output).</p>
<p>Alternator didn't make sense. Instead of 1 wire for Field input, it had
two wires.</p>
<p>Additionally, Battery Contactor didn't make sense. One terminal had a wire
going to it. The other was grounded....</p>
<div class="section" id="interlude">
<h2>Interlude</h2>
<p>Battery Contactor is an interesting point here. Normally, one terminal
is connected to the &quot;always hot&quot; side of it (basically, directly to the battery)
and the other goes to the Master Switch. Master Switch turns the Battery
Contactor on by grounding that wire, providing the negative side to the circuit.
It's a safety thing. If that wire breaks, it'll either turn the electrical off
(open circuit), or it will keep it turned on (short to ground). That's it.</p>
<p>But, one of the terminals on the Battery Contactor was grounded... that means,
that the other terminal (the wire coming from the Master Switch) must provide
positive side??? Huh? But where does it get it's power <em>from</em>?</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="tracing">
<h2>Tracing</h2>
<p>So to tracing we went. I spend maybe 10 hours trying to find diagrams
and understand that alternator and voltage regulator hookups.</p>
<p>And me tracing it spelled my doom.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-diagram">
<h2>The Diagram</h2>
<p>Now, I didn't trace the rest of it. Just the main distribution system. That was
enough.</p>
<p>Shall we?</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-05-16-fire-hazard/fh-2.jpg" title="The current  main power system of the Charger" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-05-16-fire-hazard/fh-2-thumb.jpg" title="The current  main power system of the Charger" alt="The current  main power system of the Charger" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">The current  main power system of the Charger</p><p>Yep, the diagram is missing the main power buss. It's dangling off of the
same spot where everything else that's interesting is - the
Battery Contactor (marked MA RELAY) &lt;-&gt; Starter Contactor (marked STARTER REL)
link.</p>
<p>So let's see what we have here.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Lots of unfused wires. Do you see a <em>single</em> fuse here? Nope. That's because there aren't any. All the fuses are further downstream, off of the main buss.</li>
<li>Voltage Regulator has this extra wire running to / from cockpit that isn't really necessary and could've been kept on the hot side of the firewall (terminal 4 wire)</li>
<li>Alternator field broken at <em>output</em> (F-&gt;ALT) rather than at <em>input</em> (battery -&gt; terminal 3)</li>
<li>And the best part? <strong>Always hot wire that you can't turn off</strong> between the battery and the Master Switch to turn the Master Solenoid on.</li>
</ul>
<p>That last bit bugged me. I couldn't <em>find</em> the damn thing. Even before
actually tracing it, I knew that if the Master Solenoid is switched on the &quot;hot&quot;
side, it needs to get the power from somewhere, and that only could be battery. But I didn't see <em>any</em> wires on the always hot side of the Master Solenoid.
Only when I traced it, I actually traced the physical wire to where it goes, and
then found it. It was so tucked behind the battery -&gt; Master Solenoid wire that
it was invisible:</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-05-16-fire-hazard/fh-5.jpg" title="This little !@#!S@#...." >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-05-16-fire-hazard/fh-5-thumb.jpg" title="This little !@#!S@#...." alt="This little !@#!S@#...." >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">This little !@#!S@#....</p><p>Oh; and by the way, the Master Switch is the only switch that's <em>soldered</em> in,
and w/o any good insulation around the terminals, and over-stripped wires.
So that's just waiting to short, and the magic smoke that'll be let out
behind the panel when that shorts can't be stopped (always hot wire, remember?)</p>

<div class="section" id="the-wires">
<h2>The Wires</h2>
<p>So I kinda went backwards here; but I thought it'd be easier to see the
diagram first.</p>
<p>Let's see.</p>
<p>Most of connections are made on this very nicely marked terminal block:</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-05-16-fire-hazard/fh-4.jpg" title="The terminal block" >

 </a> <p class="small text-center">The terminal block</p><p>All the switched power comes out there, and every wire is marked. This
actually helped a lot in tracing. This block is on the side of the plane,
right next to the front hole's backrest.</p>
<p>You know what threw me off the most with that damned always hot wire
(I ended up tracing it <em>physically</em>)? It's how it's hooked up.</p>
<p>Yep, it is hooked up to that terminal block. To the terminal... that is
marked.. (drumroll).... &quot;Master Switch&quot;.</p>
<p>Wait.. this actually makes sense... But where's the &quot;return&quot; from the switch?</p>
<p>Ah! It's the wire that's marked.... drumroll... &quot;Fuel Gauge&quot;!</p>
<p>So really, let's look at what's going on, shall we? Zoom in the image below, it's annotated.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-05-16-fire-hazard/fh-explained.jpg" title="Untangled" >

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Untangled</p><p>So let's see. We've got this bundle of wires, a lot of which are not fused,
and one of which is always hot.</p>
<p>The Main Buss wire is the thickest one (10 gauge maybe?) that's not fused
between this buss bar and the source (engine compartment).</p>
<p>Oh, did I mention that this buss bar is on the side of the plane near the
rear instrument panel (so that 10 gauge run, and the rest of the harness
between firewall and the panel is about 30 inches long)?</p>
<p>What else do we see there? Oh! The two little 1/16inch thick aluminum lines
carrying.. fuel pressure (and oil pressure).</p>
<p>Shall I say more?</p>
<p>Shall I say that there's a fuel tank in between the front hole (passenger) and
the firewall?</p>
<p>That the wires run along between firewall and rear cockpit along that fuel
pressure line (to fuel pressure gauge)?</p>
<p>That if one shorts to this very nearby fuel pressure line, it'll burn a hole
straight thru it, and then ignite the gas that'll start coming out?</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>Can I fix all of that?</p>
<p>Sure. But rewiring will be much much easier, because I have to touch pretty much
everything. Re-running half of individual wires in a bundle is much harder than
re-running them all.</p>
<p>So, I made a decision to rewire the plane... Sigh. Looks like I won't be
flying for a looooong time.</p>
<p>Oh, and tell you what. Tracing wires on a biplane is dangerous. I ended up twisting my knee and pulling a muscle while trying to get behind the panel so badly that I couldn't walk (or sit) for 2.5 days :(.</p>
