<hr class="dashed"/><p>No posts about the Skybolt doesn't mean that there was nothing done :). Yessir!</p>
<p>I was redrawing pretty much everything I did in the first few months of modeling the lower wing; and that ate up a bunch of time and didn't actually produce anything to show. But damn, did it suck up time!</p>
<p>I ended up re-doing:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Spars</li>
<li>All ribs</li>
<li>Full wing assembly (now it's clean and easy to tweak)</li>
<li>A lot of compression plates</li>
<li>Complete aileron assembly</li>
</ul>
<p>Especially with ribs, the problem was that I did them while learning SolidWorks -- which led me to sketching them in AutoCad first (I used to hate doing curves in SWX.. now I hate Autocad, but that's another story :)). That made them virtually un-tweakable; and &quot;tweaking&quot; the verticals, which I <a class="reference external" href="https://79ft.net/entries/2014-09-01/">had to do after confirming drag wire interference</a>, proved to be virtually impossible.</p>
<p>So, I decided to clean it all up. Oh yeah, and I have moved that interfering vertical.</p>
<p>The brand-spanking new set of ribs:</p>

<p>I started with a &quot;placeholder&quot; that was the inboard (full size) butt rib. Then, using the tip bow, I drew a couple of &quot;guide curves&quot; and projected it on a couple planes, corresponding to ribs, giving me two different profiles.</p>

<hr class="dashed"/><p>Another week and a half. Did a ton of little things; each one of which took a ton of time, with seemingly little result... I guess, devil's in the details.</p>
<p>It's constant tweaking and tuning of things that takes a bunch of time. But, at this point, most of the rough things are in, and it's that tweaking and tuning that's left to do...</p>
<p>Oh well.</p>
<div class="section" id="drag-wires-done">
<h2>Drag Wires: done.</h2>
<p>Finished all the drag wires. Initially I did an incorrect layout from the standpoint of which wire passes over which (or under which, depends on how you look at it). Apparently, I came across a definition of drag/anti-drag that's exactly the opposite of how the plans define them... Sigh.</p>
<p>Wires have to cross inside the drag wire blocks and inside the spar; so one
has to go over and one under, like this (lots of transparency here):</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Drag/Anti Drag Wires Crossing</p><p>That's the pattern I did wrong; causing some interference with the bellcrank

<p>Thanks to <a class="reference external" href="http://www.biplaneforum.com/showthread.php?t=10493">my original post on drag wire blocks interference in the aileron bay</a>, and the picture Ward
posted in that thread, I figured the wires pattern out. Switching it
around made for much better clearance!</p>
<p>Also, my original problem with aileron interfering with the drag wire blocks
is apparently no problem at all - I'll just relieve them (rasp, file, sandpaper, whatever) to provide clearance.</p>
<p>So, here's what the wing looks like right now:</p>

<h2>Aileron Bay and Drag Wires</h2>
<p>... and then, something I spent quite a number of hours on. You see, I want to
sheet the inside of the aileron bay with curved piece of 1/16th plywood, supported on braces joining ends of the ribs together.</p>
<p>A few pictures below show the idea:</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Aileron Bay Sheeting, showing the support brace.</p><p>This is all very rough. The problem though was this.</p>
<p>Here's how it looks from the wing tip side:</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Aileron Well, zoomed in.</p><p>See that clearance??? 7/64ths between the aileron tip and the nut! So even
before I started figuring out the best spline curve for that sheeting, it was obvious that it won't clear... 1/16th ply + 1/16th gap is already a 1/8th, or 8/64ths!</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.biplaneforum.com/showthread.php?t=10493">Asked the Biplane Forum folk in the same thread...</a> And, separately, actually figured it out - it was suggested to use two thin jam nuts there instead of a thin + regular nyloc.</p>
<p>That cleared a lot of space up!</p>

   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2014-09-01/well-clearance-thumb.jpg" title="Finally, some clearance!" alt="Finally, some clearance!" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Finally, some clearance!</p><p>I was thinking about modifying the tails of the wing ribs in the bay area to support this sheeting.. But, even with thin jam nuts, the bay is still very tight. Given that I won't be able to build exactly to perfect dimensions, I finally decided not to bother, and just build in place (and then we'll see what clearance I really will be able to get :)</p>
<p>Backup plan? Have some drag wire hardware protrude into the bay, and sheeting be not &quot;in front of it&quot;, but somewhat behind it (closer to the main wing spar).  <a class="reference external" href="http://www.biplaneforum.com/showpost.php?p=103052&amp;postcount=17">Something like this.</a></p>

<h2>Cleaning a lot of things up</h2>
<p>Added all the hardware to the aileron hinges. Cleaned up most of the compression plates (doublers) to go around the compression struts and drag wires.</p>
<p>Oh, and apparently, my aileron hinges were drawn a bit wrong (and had that unsightly early model of Fafnir rod end I have thrown together). Fixed that. Made them pretty green color to celebrate the occasion :).</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Station 24 vertical and diagonal interference.</p><p>Hale Wallace in his notes suggested to relocate station 24 vertical to 23 3/4, 1/4 inch forward (or &quot;left&quot; in the above picture). This will make the diagonal more steep, and clear the drag wires. I'll have to do that.</p>
<p>Another nasty. I was ready for this, and, sure enough, the bellcrank/idler pushrod doesn't clear the compression struts. The idler will have to be made lower; Steen bends them downward and I will see if I can avoid that by just moving it down a bit (and moving the idler arm down on it's bushing).</p>

<h2>Ribs</h2>
<p>So, I started looking at relocating that vertical first.</p>
<p>My ribs' models are the first ones I did in Solid Works; and they <em>suck</em>. They are made off of sketches created from converted AutoCAD files, with lots of ugly things in them. They are practically unmodifiable. Back then I thought it was easier to draw things in AutoCAD and import them to SWX - oh, what an idiot I was :).</p>
<p>Also, while looking at things, it became clear that they also are not sitting right on spars (not symmetrical to spars' center plane basically).</p>
<p>It feels like I will end up re-drawing them from scratch, and doing them as proper assemblies this time. We'll see.</p>
<p>It might well be that <a class="reference external" href="https://79ft.net/entries/2014-05-21/">the problem I was having with aileron-to-other-ribs-alignment</a> will go away, and no holes will need to be relocated...</p>
<p>It's annoying, but at this time I am so much better with SWX than back a year ago when I was doing ribs. Still, Le Sigh.</p>

<h2>Aileron Tip Rib, Wing Tip Rib, and Tip Bow</h2>
<p>I've been putting this off, since those tip ribs are not dimensioned on the plans, and aren't a standard airfoil. They're supposed to create a nice transition from the main wing panel into the tip bow, creating some nice curvature.</p>
<p>I had the wing tip rib drawn up approximately, just as a placeholder.</p>
<p>Yesterday, I did an approximate aileron tip rib as well. Cutting it out of the plan and super-imposing two patters on one another helped! Plans are off (dimensions marked on them are not matching the dimensions measured off of them), but at least they're off uniformly within  one sheet; allowing me to do this.  It shows what's where.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Tip Rib, cut out - finally, some physical work on the "plane"!</p><p>Well, for one, it became obvious that the top aileron skin on the leading edge will have to create a compound curve going to the tip rib.</p>
<p>Searching thru the Forum, and reading things showed that apparently it's not that big of a problem. Gradual gluing and lots of clamping pressure should solve that one. :)</p>
<p>And then, there's the overall tip rib shape.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2014-09-01/bow.jpg" title="Overall setup." >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2014-09-01/bow-thumb.jpg" title="Overall setup." alt="Overall setup." >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Overall setup.</p><p>This is all very early with no &quot;trimming cuts&quot; made, obviously.</p>
<p>If you think about it, the aileron tip rib is supposed to be a bit &quot;beefier&quot; (&quot;taller&quot;) than the wing tip rib. The tail of the aileron tip rib in the place where it's touching the bow should be 3/4 inches tall (so that it's flush with the bow).</p>
<p>All that will create nice smooth &quot;flow&quot; of curves from the last &quot;full size&quot; airfoil section (created by the wing rib and the aileron rib) into the tip ribs and tip bow.</p>
<p>So, first thing I'm not sure about is how good my tip rib (wing rib that is) is. I think the aileron tip rib should &quot;play off&quot; the wing tip rib's shape... In fact, if you lay a straightedge between the tip rib and the aileron rib with aileron positioned at 0 degree deflection, moving that straightedge should define the form of the aileron tip rib. I will do just that, later, lofting the surface that will &quot;cut&quot; the aileron tip rib out (and use a real straightedge with some sandpaper glued to it to shape the actual aileron's tip rib). I love it how CADing makes you think about these things!</p>
<p>But! That requires me to have a nice wing tip rib. Which I don't have. So to that task then, first.</p>
<p>Skybolt plans have the general outline and no grid on them. It's not a standard airfoil. Hmmm...</p>
<p>Last time I did it, I took dimensions off of plans. It turned out a bit off shape-wise if compared visually to the plans, so I tweaked it a bit. I still don't like that tip rib.</p>
<p>To the Firebolt!</p>
<p>Firebolt, by the way, is Skybolt, &quot;improved&quot; (and by that I mean added weight). Fuselage is a few inches longer, and hardware is all different; but basic wing design and overall things are the same. It makes it a great reference to read thru and see how things are done there.</p>
<p>Firebolt's wing tip rib is located at the same station as Skybolt's. That gives me some hope :).</p>
<p>Firebolt plans are also off (print dimensions not matching actual on sheets), but at least they have the grid -- amount of error accumulated over 1 inch of measurment hopefully is negligible. We'll have to see.</p>

<p>It's also clear that they interfere with the control system. Well, Ill have
to adjust that when I finish the wires' models.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, added all the compression struts and working on the drag / anti-drag

so I have to figure out what goes on top and what goes on the bottom). HFW
did a good starting layout in his addendum to Plans, so going off of that

<h2>Incidence and Fittings: Finishing Up</h2>
<p>First, the incidence.
<a class="reference external" href="https://79ft.net/entries/2014-06-17/">Last time</a>,
I was trying to figure out how to deal with vertical fittings having to align
with spars angled at 1.5 degrees up (incidence). <a class="reference external" href="http://www.biplaneforum.com/showthread.php?t=10195">A good discussion on the
Forum</a> ensued, and
I figured (aside from me having to buy a +/- .0001 Precision Axe), to drill
the hole at 1.5 degree angle in the front fitting, and forget about
the little gap that shows up there, and weld the rear fitting
in place. So something like this (you're looking at the fitting pair from the
side, the CL is the hole centerline).</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2014-08-12/fittings-pair.jpg" title="A pair of fittings, with the hole drilled at an angle" >

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Gap that shows up when fittings are vertical, and hole is at an angle.</p><p>Note to self: When building / finish welding, I might reconsider and bend the
tops of that fitting 1.5 degrees back to make everything flush. I probably will.</p>

<div class="section" id="back-to-the-control-system">
<h2>Back to the Control System</h2>
<p>Next item on the list was bellcrank-to-aileron pushrod, which is tricky. See,
if it's straight, it doesn't clear all the hardware.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2014-08-12/bellcrank-pushrod.jpg" title="Pushrod is not clearing hardware if straight" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2014-08-12/bellcrank-pushrod-thumb.jpg" title="Pushrod is not clearing hardware if straight" alt="Pushrod is not clearing hardware if straight" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Pushrod is not clearing hardware if straight</p><p>So it had to be slightly bent to make the bellcrank side rod-end a bit more
&quot;horizontal&quot;, if you will, while not &quot;horizontal&quot; enough to hit the spar above.</p>
<p>This sounds easy; and probably is -- but tweaking splines, checking, re-checking
and tweaking again while checking for full range of aileron's motion took up
most of the time here.. I think I spent a good 10 hours or so just tweaking that
one pushrod... And finally, here it is -- notice a slight bend in it. Just a
touch  less bend and it hits the washer under the bellcrank side rod end, just
a touch more, and it gets dangerously close to the spar.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Aileron pushrod, tweaked to fit</p><p>Finally, I was able to move the aileron linkage on the wing model and check
the idler - bellcrank pushrod for ribs' verticals clearance. It clears! There's
another clearance issue though - by the looks of it, it won't clear the
compression struts (3/4 x 3/4 inch struts go in the middle of the ribs, forming
wing bays along with drag/anti-drag wires) by the looks of it. So struts and
wires it is, next, amongst other things..</p>

<h2>Fitting Wings To the Fuse</h2>
<p>For some reason, Solid Works gods decided to start hating me here.
Remember the note about angled hole in the front wing fittings pair?
Assuming that pair is mated to the fuse (lower longeron);
front spar butt hole (ha.. ha ha.. haha..) mated to
that angled hole in the fittings' pair should produce correct incidence;
and dihedral can be set with wing spar centerline
mated to, say, one of the fuselage's crossmember's centerlines, at required 1
degree angle? Ha! Yes; that worked -- but for some reason,
would cause all kinds of shenanigans the moment I would make the
SWX assembly flexible (== allowing me to move control surfaces of the
wing sub-assembly as a part of the overall assembly).</p>
<p>Yeah-right. -3 hours of my life until I gave up.</p>
<p>Instead, I made a virtual &quot;jig&quot; -- another sub-assembly containing planes
at correct dihedral and incidence angles. Wing's &quot;Top&quot; plane would mate to
the &quot;wing&quot; plane of the &quot;jig&quot;; latter (&quot;wing&quot; plane) would be at 1.5 degree
incidence / 1 degree dihedral. That worked.</p>

<p>That, for whatever reason, worked. After that, 10 more minutes of making one
final pushrod connecting idler to Actuator Arm on the Torque Tube, and..</p>

<hr class="dashed"/><p>Today, ended up messing around with putting the lower wing and the fuselage
together...</p>
<p>Lower wings are set up at 1.5 degree incidence, 1.0 dihedral.</p>
<p>Started with that I realized that I mis-positioned the hole on the front
spar and gear fitting. Simple fix :)</p>
<p>Next, came a lot of thinking and reading. Here's the problem.</p>
<p>The plans position fittings perpendicular to the longeron.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2014-06-17/fittings-longeron.jpg" title="Fittings on the lower longeron" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2014-06-17/fittings-longeron-thumb.jpg" title="Fittings on the lower longeron" alt="Fittings on the lower longeron" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Fittings on the lower longeron</p><p>Holes are co-linear, and incidence is achieved because of the stagger in the
attach holes on the spars. Airfoil chord, tilted up 1.5 degrees make these
holes come together.</p>
<p>The problem is that spar sides then become non-coplanar with the fittings'
faces; possibly introducing bad fit, play, misalignment, and
whatever problems I can't think of.</p>
<p>Here's how the spars go 'into' the fittings. I circled the rear spar, since
Ill use that for illustrating the problem.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Spars on fuse (rest of wing hidden from view not to obstruct</p><p>Now, looking at it from the tip of the spar towards the fuselage, you can see
the angle between the fitting and the spar. That's because of 1.5
degrees of incidence.</p>

<hr class="dashed"/><p>For starters, cleaned up the torque tube; added all the hardware (thanks
cwilliamrose again for AN hardware models!) and proper mates.
Was a nice warm-up, and came out real well.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">... and zoomed in.</p><p>Notice on the above picture how they interfere with the tubes of the fuse
truss (geometry penetrates one another). There are a couple ways to fix that;
plans just call for 'trimming in place'.
Note to self: figure out if the weld should only be around the bottom longeron;
or if to weld the top of the fitting to the vertical too?</p>
<p>The cool thing about SW is that I can &quot;cut&quot; in place; add a bit of margin
on the real pattern for the fitting, and make it to fit without constant trial
and error.</p>
<p>And then, lower wing rear fitting.. that one is tricky due to the way it's
dimensioned on the plans (it makes sense plan-wise, since it maintains
clearances between longerons and spar butts, etc; so hole positioning takes
metal thickness into the account). Can't believe it took me 2 hours and a few
tries to figure out how to model this right. Learning curves be damned :)</p>

<hr class="dashed"/><p>In the past couple of evenings; have continued hanging virtual control system
on the virtual wings.</p>
<p>Thanks to CWilliamRose from Biplane Forum, I now have quite a bit of models
of AN / MILSPEC bearings.. REP3H5 included, but he didn't have REP4H6, so that
had to be done first..</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2014-06-09/rep4h6.jpg" title="REP4H6 bearing model" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2014-06-09/rep4h6-thumb.jpg" title="REP4H6 bearing model" alt="REP4H6 bearing model" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">REP4H6 bearing model</p><p>Couldn't find a few dimensions; but my rationale is as long as the basic
eye height / bore / shank are there, and the ball 'rotates', that's good
enough for the purpose of my alignment checking, for now at least. Ill
revisit if I start getting into tight corners.</p>
<p>Next, hung the Idler, bearings, cleaned up the model (funny, lower wing
assembly is technically my <em>first</em> serious SolidWorks model, so I keep cleaning
it up as I go, killing stupid things I did back when I didn't know any better).</p>
<p>Sigh... I will need to hang the wing onto the fuselage model to make sure the
pushrod doesn't hit verticals -- clearance is there, but might not be enough.</p>
<p>Here's the wing model with the pushrod:</p>

<hr class="dashed"/><p>It's almost 5 am and Im finally done with the bellcrank alignment! Phew.</p>
<p>By the way, sheet metal stuff in Solid Works is amazing! You give it the
bend lines, radii, and a couple more parameters; and it automatically creates
both the bent item; as well as the flat pattern. Print the pattern, glue,
and start bending -- it will show you which line, how many degrees, and in which
direction to bend. Ill post one of those final drawings later, when I get
around to printing them and bending some actual metal :).</p>
<p>Anyway...</p>
<p>The night started quite jolly with me whipping out the idler arm with it's
bracket. Looks pretty neat, eh?</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Aileron Idler Arm and Bracket</p><p>And then, back to the bellcrank hell. I had it modeled back in the days,
and the &quot;jog&quot; bend 1/2 inches down made. Here's how busy the sketch with all
the radii and holes looks BTW; pre-bending.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Bellcrank layout</p><p>Anyway, with all the sheet metal awesomeness SolidWorks doesn't know how to
twist. You can twist a model by using deformation, but at that point all
kinds of shenanigans begin to happen. For example, all faces of the model
stop being planar faces (meaning nothing can be sketched on them, and sketch
is how you start defining a feature (part of the model)); for some reason I
wasn't able to put a reference
point into the center of one of the holes, etc. (I ended up drawing that
point finally by projecting that hole's centerline onto one of the faces;
that <em>did</em> work for whatever the weird reason Solid Works gods must have).</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Bellcrank, bent and twisted</p><p>And after fiddling with it for about an hour, I was finally able to position
everything. The plans don't specify where the bracket should be, so my educated
and logical (yes, mr. Spock?) guess was that it should be so that the aileron
pushrod connecting bellcrank to the alieron hinge is aligned and straight in the
&quot;aileron neutral&quot; position. So I used the aileron hinge center as the
reference; squared the bellcrank and aligned it that way. Note the blue
line (that's actually a plane bisecting the aileron
hinge), and the Point1 (that's that wretched point on the twisted surface
that took me so long to figure out). That's what I used for alignment.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Bellcrank mated and aligned with aileron hinge</p><p>Coming up, putting in the idler, all the pushrods, and checking clearances
with rib truss throughout the full range of motion. I strongly suspect that I
will need the control stick's model on the fuse to do that, since that's what
the other end of that pushrod attaches to. Oh man... gotta love those
dependencies. That just means that I will have to do that model earlier than
planned. Oh well. I like Solid Works anyways...</p>
<p>Tomorrow's the Shop Day! Gotta clean and put that compressor together.</p>
<p>OK 5:11 AM; time to go get some sleep :)</p>

<hr class="dashed"/><p>Today, got only about an hour and a half for CADing. Re-opened my Lower Wing
model, 50% thru or so, and started remembering things and checking
things around.</p>
<p>I was right at a point when I hung the ailerons on the wings, and this time
was re-checking the alignment again, only to find that they were off! Looked
like they were lower than the rest of the wing ribs, by about 1/16th.
Clearly visible on the screenshot below.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2014-05-21/off.jpg" title="Black lines are aileron outline, orange lines are wing ribs" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2014-05-21/off-thumb.jpg" title="Black lines are aileron outline, orange lines are wing ribs" alt="Black lines are aileron outline, orange lines are wing ribs" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Black lines are aileron outline, orange lines are wing ribs</p><p>Started digging around and re-checking the hinges, holes, etc, with plans. The
'spar' side hinges are the most complex ones, and they were fine.. When checking
the aileron assembly though, noticed this, which struck me as odd (and a bit
illogical):</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2014-05-21/off-on-spar.jpg" title="Aileron hinge sticking a bit 'above' the spar" >

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Aileron hinge sticking a bit 'above' the spar</p><p>Notice it sticking up? 3/32nds! Close to 1/16th. Arguably, there will be the
filler there, but it still seems illogical (yes, mr Spock? :) ).</p>
<p>Anyways, moving the spar attach holes on the hinge up by 1/16ths (plans call
for 3/8ths between the top of the hinge and the top hole center), so 5/16ths
it is. That moved the whole aileron up on the hinge, and therefore, relative
to the wing, and voila - a perfect match!</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Match!</p><p>Yay! A perfect match.</p>
<p>Now, I know that in reality I will be drilling holes in spars in place based on
the pilots in the hinges (or the other way around, hinges based on holes in
spars (damn.. Im yet to decide.. :) ); but I'd rather start 'clean'.</p>
