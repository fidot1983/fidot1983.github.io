<hr class="dashed"/><p>So this one turned into a month long project, give or take. Sure, sure, I was doing other things, too: last one of which was completed
October 9th... after which I was finishing this one exclusively, pretty much.</p>
<p>Damn. One month to finish putting the brakes together. Granted, I had a hiatus for a week and a half, dealing with fixing up bad
(non-aircraft) plumbing and cutting (non-aircraft-grade) trees.</p>
<p>Regardless... Shall we?</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>After having <a class="reference external" href="http://79ft.net/entries/2019-09-30-brake-line/">finished making the new brake line</a>, I naturally wanted to install
it and call brakes done.</p>
<p>Some of the disassembly work documented here actually happened <em>prior</em> to the new line being bent up, but hey. Putting it all in one
place makes for a better narrative in <em>one</em> context.</p>
<div class="section" id="first-the-calipers">
<h2>First, the Calipers</h2>
<p>... one of which was cracked due to someone having overtightened the bleeder adapter. Oh well.</p>

pads were soaked, from under the brake piston. Probably the o-ring was bust, and it was weeping from between
the caliper and the piston. It seems that it had been a feature of the plane for a while.</em></p>
<p><em>Jumping a bit ahead of myself, on the other side, I discovered the brake disk somewhat dirty with oil - crankcase breather hoses
are routed into the _left_ side wheelpant and terminate near the disk - clearly, spraying a bit of oil on and around it. You'll see
those hoses on the pics of the left wheel below.</em></p>
<p><em>I think Remo's idea was to prevent oil on the belly from the breather. My friend's Ben contention was, this was a brake lock-up
prevention measure; and when he brought it up, I immediately realized... leaking piston on the _right_ caliper was a lock-up
prevention measure as well - to make sure both brakes are equally slippery - right one with brake fluid, left one with motor
oil... At any rate,..</em></p>
<p>I will admit, this was my first caliper job ever, and anchor pins presented a bit of a problem. They're press fit in the
caliper, and I didn't have an arbor press. Well, I used an old 1/4 nut that I banged on (gently!), and finished with a drift punch....</p>

<p>That little doodad was leaking for a long time, too. It seemed it was leaking from the little cam arm that rotates, but I wasn't sure,

<p>There are alternatives. Cheapest one is like what, hundred fifty bucks; and I'll have to work around it's plumbing
(which is different than mine); and the &quot;direct fit&quot; &quot;homebuilt&quot; cheapest one is over $300? No way. No way in hell until
I try to fix this.</p>
<p>What is the hole? 1/8 NPT? McMaster sells taps for $25, two new fittings are what... under $30, and a handful of o-rings, which
of course I didn't have (I have a bunch of o-rings in a ton of sizes for fuel applications, but not for brake applications).</p>
<p>We'll try to re-tap that hole; hopefully braking the piece of the thread left in there by the fitting while keeping the female

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Flushed, and drying</p><p>Do you see the other mistake I made? Yep. I mixed up the bearings (&quot;front&quot; and &quot;back&quot;). Bearings should always stay with their races...</p>
<p>Oh well. After some research, seems that the worst that will happen is wear will get accelerated.. since the bearings and races
looked squeaky clean, I decided to keep them as is.. for now. And just Hail Mary the position (since I have a 50% chance of getting
it right :)).</p>
<p>I decided to replace all the felts because I was changing grease from I didn't know what kind but likely red Mobil grease to Aeroshell 22.</p>
<p>Ironically, I apparently didn't take a single picture of the bearings being greased - probably because my hands were too greasy doing them :). Oh well.</p>
<p>The new felts came, and got coated in grease.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">One of new felts</p><p>And, I put the wheel back together. And then... And then, I couldn't tighten it back right. I have to align the hole in the axle nut for
the cotter pin... I could either get it under-tight (with perceptible play in the bearings - not good), or a bit over-tight (so that
the wheel will spin, but with some measure of resistance). Remember, I said that my mistake number one was not checking how
freely this wheel spun prior to pulling it off? Now, I was paying for it.</p>
<p>I tried flipping the bearings around (because I didn't note their original positions), thinking that maybe that will help. Nope. No change
at all.</p>
<p>Oh well.  I couldn't do anything about that at that point, so decided to settle on &quot;a bit tighter&quot; option.</p>

got tightened to super tight, loosened, and tightened to finger tight - and the wheel was perfect. No play, and no &quot;drag&quot;.</p>
<p>Le double sigh.</p>
<p>So finally, it was the time to put things back together!</p>

<p>Phew. Now, finally, we can bleed and test!</p>

<h2>Bleeding</h2>
<p>Now, there are two approaches to bleeding brakes - either bottom up (push fluid up thru the bleeder valves), or top down (sit in the
plane and squeeze the pedals while the other guy opens and closes the bleeder). Bottom up is inherently simpler.</p>
<p>Some time ago, my buddy Dick was showing off his fancy bleeder he got from ATS.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">DIY brake bleeder</p><p>Pump it with air, open the valve, and the brake fluid gets pushed out thru the line that attaches to the bleeder valve on the caliper.
Child's play.</p>
<p>For bleeding, I dragged my good friend Nick S. to give me a helping hand. I could've done this by myself, but having someone watching over
the &quot;other end&quot; (it either being the end that pushes the fluid in, or the end out of which the fluid comes out) makes the job much
more pleasant.</p>
<p>Now, the way brakes are plumbed on the Charger is, each side goes from it's caliper up the gear leg to the parking brake valve, then
to the Master Cylinder, and from there both Master Cylinders are plumbed into a tee, from which the single line (the one I was re-making earlier) goes to the reservoir on the firewall.</p>
<p>We decided to bleed each side up to the tee first - to minimize the amount of air ending in the &quot;common&quot; line between the tee and the
firewall. After bleeding each side up to the tee, we'd attach the &quot;common&quot; line and bleed each side up to the reservoir, letting at least
a cup of fluid to flow thru, ensuring that we push all the air out.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">The setup</p><p>The plan went without a hitch, aside from the fact that I initially forgot to open the parking brake, and was trying to figure out why
the hell the fluid won't flow. Hehe. Nick called it, too!</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Nick holding the fluid line from reservoir</p><p>Finally, the moment of truth. The brakes were firm and nice, held well, and no leaks nowhere! Now, I need to double-check this - next
time I'm in the hangar for a good few hours, I'll set the parking brake to keep the pressure in lines, and see what happens - but
initially, everything held just fine! Phew.</p>
<p>So finally, the last bit was left.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="finishing-the-new-line-install">
<h2>Finishing the New Line Install</h2>
<p>Now, the new line was finally in place, and all that was left was to install some ADELs to hold it.</p>

<p>Now, there are fancy mods to ViceGrips (or you can buy them for sizeable chunks of cash pre-made) to hold ADEL clamps together while
you're inserting the screw and starting the nut. I don't have them.</p>
<p>Some people use safety wire.</p>
<p>I decided to try...</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Lacing cord!</p><p>It works great, too! Just double up and &quot;noose&quot; it around - it holds a clamp like a charm in the &quot;closed&quot; position while
you fiddle with the nut! Even Jack came out to see that.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Jack inspecting the work</p><p>With those clamps installed, I had to tie a bundle of wires going across the tube to the front stick's PTT switch. That one was one hell
of a contortion exercise, under the front seat's front edge and behind the stick, but I managed after a couple of tries.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Lacing the wires to brake fluid line and structure</p><p>And finally, a couple more clamps along the length of the line on the fuse to hold it in place there. Some TorqSeal, and we're done!</p>
<p>I worked out a method to these, finally, I think. I use a long (~2 inches) AN3 bolt first to &quot;thread&quot; the clamps on, and then close them
with a wrap of lacing cord using the &quot;noose&quot; method (<a class="reference external" href="http://www.aeroelectric.com/articles/cable_lace/cable_lace.html">&quot;Method 2&quot; here</a>). I then remove the long bolt, install the final bolt, and start the nut. When the nut brings clamps almost to a close, I cut off the
nooses, and tighten the nut. Works like a charm!</p>

<p>PS: I was considering where to put this - under &quot;2019 Annual&quot; or &quot;Electrical Rebuild&quot; category... decided to pile it into the &quot;Electrical

<hr class="dashed"/><p>Prior to mounting the <a class="reference external" href="http://79ft.net/entries/2019-09-30-brake-line/">newly finished brake line</a>, I wanted to finish
fastening everything that's around it - so that I minimize wrenching around the brand new line.</p>
<p>Voltage Regulator is one of the bits that will go right there, so it was to be done.</p>
<p>I was working on it's mounting, on and off, and eventually got stuck with <a class="reference external" href="http://79ft.net/entries/2019-10-08-good-crimps/">attempting to solder a short grounding
strap</a> that was to go under one of the &quot;standoffs&quot; for the regulator.</p>
<p>And then, I was making the new brake line - but now that is done too. I also figured out how
to make that ground strap. So. nothing prevented me from completing the voltage regulator install.</p>
<p>But, we're getting ahead of ourselves.</p>
<p>First, the holes.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-10-09-vr-mounted/vr-2.jpg" title="Holes" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-10-09-vr-mounted/vr-2-thumb.jpg" title="Holes" alt="Holes" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Holes</p><p>How do you drill real good, round, quality holes, you ask?</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-10-09-vr-mounted/vr-3.jpg" title="Tools!" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-10-09-vr-mounted/vr-3-thumb.jpg" title="Tools!" alt="Tools!" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Tools!</p><p>Well. All those tools were participating in making of those holes, in sequence. Here's a game: name that sequence!</p>
<p>And then, the mounts. The regulator was to be on standoffs, to &quot;raise&quot; it above that rivet line.
The regulator wants two grounds, which will go under two of the standoffs. I also wanted to have a ground strap go under
a standoff.</p>
<p>Now, I have to explain the ground strap. I already mentioned spending quality time trying to make it.</p>
<p>I want to set up good grounding architecture in my all new electrical. This side conduit, to which the regulator is mounting, is key.</p>
<p>It's continuous, and aluminum - so it presents a really nice grounding point. I am planning to add jumpers between it and the
firewall, and it and the instrument panel, tying it all up nicely. Loads will be grounded to the conduit, firewall,
and instrument panel only.</p>
<p>Since the voltage regulator is right next to the firewall, it's very logical to have the ground strap under one of it's stands. And besides, there is already
a convenient hole right next to it for the firewall side of the grounding strap - which is why the strap is very short.</p>
<p>At any rate, those three terminals under three out of four standoffs for the regulator are making  hardware stacks of varying
thicknesses per standoff, so standoffs need to be individually sized to keep the regulator overall &quot;level&quot; above the conduit.</p>
<p>Another fly in the ointment is that &quot;jog&quot; created by one portion of the conduit riveted on top of another - that has to be
accounted for, too.</p>
<p>So four individual standoffs.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">The old brake line</p><p>I needed to relocate this bad boy to free up room for the Voltage Regulator. This is the older picture - I have long
bent it out of the way and cut off a chunk. It was to be relocated to run below the conduit.</p>
<p>Well, first, we had to locate the hole in the firewall. And that depended on the line to the reservoir, firewall forward.</p>
<p>After having thunk a bit about it, decided to replace the 90 degree fitting in the reservoir with the 45 degree; and
the firewall bulkhead fitting with a 90 degree. That'd minimize the amount of bends and make for a neat job.</p>
<p>So, firewall forward we go first - that will locate the bulkhead fitting and the hole.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Mockup one</p><p>This is with old fittings in the firewall and the reservoir. The clamp on the mockup line is using an existing
hole in the firewall - nice happenstance; I'd have to plug it with a &quot;blank&quot; bolt otherwise.</p>
<p>Then, &quot;project&quot; the tube onto the firewall, roughly mark the center, and drill!</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">New hole!</p><p>And now, to the most fun part. Making the tube.</p>
<p>This was another first - never done tubes and flares before, so first of, had to figure out how to flare them
properly.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Flaring tool</p><p>Question: by how far does the tube have to stick out of it to arrive at the correct size flare?</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Practice (evidence)</p><p>Answer: 0.035. For the -4 tube. :) Yeah, those practice flares are not ALL the ones I made. Just some of them.</p>
<p>OKay, so the next question was how to actually make it fit.</p>
<p>My first thought was,</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-09-30-brake-line/b-5.jpg" title="Bottom hooked up, top not bent yet" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-09-30-brake-line/b-5-thumb.jpg" title="Bottom hooked up, top not bent yet" alt="Bottom hooked up, top not bent yet" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Bottom hooked up, top not bent yet</p><ul class="simple">
<li>Hook up the long portion (bottom)</li>
<li>Mark out the centerline of where the bend should be</li>
<li>Bend</li>
</ul>
<p>The tubing bender has alignments marks for where the marked CL should go for different angles of bends.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-09-30-brake-line/b-7.jpg" title="Marking centerline" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-09-30-brake-line/b-7-thumb.jpg" title="Marking centerline" alt="Marking centerline" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Marking centerline</p><p>What I didn't realize is that on this short a run, even a little error (bend being off of the ideal centerline by as little
as 1/16&quot;) would cause a total misalignment.</p>
<p>It did, of course.</p>
<p>Okay, second try.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-09-30-brake-line/b-10.jpg" title="Real material!" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-09-30-brake-line/b-10-thumb.jpg" title="Real material!" alt="Real material!" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Real material!</p><p>I pulled out the roll of the new tubing, too. Partly to motivate me. Partly because I ran out of the chunk I've cut off
of the old line.</p>
<p>This time, the idea was to bend it <em>first</em> and get the bend angle just right. Then, trim to correct length.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-09-30-brake-line/b-12.jpg" title="Bend angle first" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-09-30-brake-line/b-12-thumb.jpg" title="Bend angle first" alt="Bend angle first" >

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Trim, flare, hook up the bottom and mark the top</p><p>This actually worked.</p>
<p>Question. If you have a fitting with a flared end, where to place the cut mark, so that after you cut, and deburr, and
flare it, while it's sticking out of the flaring tool (un)-precisely 0.035&quot;, it fits?</p>
<p>Answer? I don't know. I think I got lucky :)</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Installed</p><p>It fits perfect. I have no idea why the fitting there looks crooked - probably weird camera angle. It's straight :).</p>
<p>Okay. Time for the Big Kahuna - the actual long line, running along the conduit, and under passenger's seat.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-09-30-brake-line/b-21.jpg" title="Under the seat it goes.." >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-09-30-brake-line/b-21-thumb.jpg" title="Under the seat it goes.." alt="Under the seat it goes.." >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Under the seat it goes..</p><p>See that line? It goes down, turns, turns again, and again, and then goes to the center of front seat's front, and goes
under.</p>
<p>It was rubbing against structure in a spot, too - so I wanted to clean all that up.</p>
<p>~30 minutes of head scratching yielded clamping arrangement that would work.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-09-30-brake-line/b-25.jpg" title="Clamps" >

He uses similar arrangement to organize wires along motor mounts. Genius, really - and I have never
seen this before (but I likely am a total idiot, anyway).</p>
<p>One final mock-up, and we're good to go.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Safety wire for mockup</p><p>BTW. How do you make safety wire straight? Chuck it into a drill, and spin a bit :). It'll work harden a touch, and
straighten out.</p>
<p>Okay, now, let's do the actual new line.</p>
<p>Unbend a long enough piece of tubing from the roll.
Pull out the old line. (and use it as a template!)</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-09-30-brake-line/b-27.jpg" title="First two bends" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-09-30-brake-line/b-27-thumb.jpg" title="First two bends" alt="First two bends" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">First two bends</p><p>Old line on the top, new on the bottom. I made the &quot;tip&quot; (that first section on the left) longer and planned to
flare it later - can you guess, will that bite me or not? ;)</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-09-30-brake-line/b-30.jpg" title="Getting close" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-09-30-brake-line/b-30-thumb.jpg" title="Getting close" alt="Getting close" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Getting close</p><p>Once I got to the point where the complex section (the one that goes from under the seat, to the side of the plane, and then up, and down again to run parallel to the conduit), it was time to try it on.</p>
<p>Maneuver it in.. it fits! Perfect! Bends clear all the right spots and fit in all the tight places.</p>
<p>Okay, now, time to actually attach it to the fitting under the passenger seat, hook it up with temp clamps, and do final bends
and trim to final length in place.</p>
<p>But first, I need to flare that end - the one to go under the seat, where I left somewhat a longer stub to be trimmed later.</p>
<p>I trim it. Perfect length.</p>
<p>Crap! It does not go into my flaring tool now.  It's way too short for it. WAAAY too short.</p>
<p>See, the flaring tool has some thickness to it. The sleeve has to fit on the tubing before you flare, and takes up another 1/4&quot;
of it's length. And, it won't go thru the bend. So there's a certain minimum length of straight tubing required for you to be
able to flare it.</p>
<p>And, I already cut it off :( And I can't unbend it - it'll just break.</p>
<p><em>Okay, I'll admit to this. I did try to unbend it. I annealed it back to soft (torch + sharpie as temp indicator) and
actually did succeed at it. But, bend flattens the tube some - and the sleeve still won't go over it.</em></p>
<p><em>Besides, bending this big Kahuna was actually not that hard - much easier than I thought, with old line acting as
template. And, I  had enough tubing. So, I decided to re-bend a new one</em>.</p>
<p>Second try, I flared <em>first</em>. And then, I realized that Remo has probably bent his with a different kind of bender, or had
a different kind of flaring tool - my bender would make that first section a bit longer than what the original line had.</p>
<p>Well... it wouldn't interfere with anything (I checked). It'll make it run a bit at an angle, and stick out from the
seat a bit more... a bit uglier, but not a big deal (and I'll try to massage it into a bit more parallel run during final
install).</p>

<p>OKay, so now to final bends and trimming.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Still needs to be bent and trimmed</p><p>There'll need to be two more bends - &quot;down&quot; to follow the conduit and &quot;out&quot; to hook up to the bulkhead fitting on the firewall.</p>
<p>That geometry would need to ensure that I have enough straight tube to successfully flare it - learned my lesson there :).</p>
<p>So, our little safety wire mockup to the rescue.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">First bend made, marking / eyeballing the second</p><p>What I didn't realize is that this long line is much easier than a short stub. Even if you make a mistake, you can massage
the line into compliance, &quot;smudging&quot; your mistake over the whole length - mistakes like wrong angle, a bit short here, etc.</p>
<p>Though, marking precisely does help. :)</p>

I want to install the voltage
regulator first, too, because that will minimize me messing with fasteners in the vicinity of this line.</p>
<p>Oh well.</p>
<p>PS: at the time of this writing, I am actually more than 50% thru with <em>both</em> of finishing up brakes, and voltage regulator. :).</p>

<p>Remo had these nice placards all over the airplane. Professionally done. Very well looking. He probably ordered them
somewhere, or used a technique I am not aware of.</p>
<p>These placards are mostly glued on, and do not come off.</p>
<p>How do I know?</p>
<p>Well, I needed to remove <em>one</em>, in the side conduit. Here it is,..</p>

<div class="section" id="switch-anti-rotation-holes">
<h2>Switch Anti-Rotation Holes</h2>
<p>You have probably figured by now that I have a taste for misery, and for ranting about how miserable that or this was :). If
you read a <em>few</em> notes in this Dear Diary, you will notice a trend - that I tend to come up with ways  of making myself
aggravated, very consistently and reliably.</p>
<p>Well, this time it was the &quot;anti-rotation&quot; holes for switches in the panel; and the plan was to drill them from
the <em>back side</em> of the panel <em>not quite all the way thru</em> (yay, no access and contortionism again!)</p>
<p>Every switch, circuit breaker, and certainly, a dimmer, comes with a &quot;keyed&quot; washer to prevent it's rotation. That means
you're drilling two holes - one for the appliance (switch, or whatever), and the other for the little tab that's on the
washer.</p>
<p>Picture explains this better. Here is a little hole template I quickly drew in Solidworks, properly dimensioned,
with washers from (left to right) the circuit breaker, switch, and the dimmer.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-09-10-panel-holes-compass/p-2.jpg" title="Holes template" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-09-10-panel-holes-compass/p-2-thumb.jpg" title="Holes template" alt="Holes template" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Holes template</p><p>See, Remo didn't have those &quot;secondary&quot; holes on the panel - so I had to drill them (especially for the dimmer).</p>
<p>But wait, you ask. If you drill holes, that will be ugly - a hole next to every switch?</p>
<p>Yup. Aha. Agreed! Though the nuts are supposed to cover them, they, I'm pretty sure, from my testing at least, wouldn't
have...</p>
<p>No problem! Remo made the panel from 1/8&quot; thick aluminum, and I needed maybe <em>half</em> that much for the tabs to go in. So
the plan was to very carefully drill them just deep enough to house the tabs.</p>
<p>Made me a nice little set of templates...</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-09-10-panel-holes-compass/p-3.jpg" title="Templates in the making" >

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Templates, cut up</p><p>...and cleaned up the holes and edges.</p>
<p>The plan was, to put a template like a &quot;washer&quot; around a switch/CB/..., and center punch the secondary, small, hole, thru it.
Then, I'll have punch marks to drill, and will have to either get to them from the side of the plane, or, more likely, from the <em>back</em> of
the panel while sitting in the seat and <em>not seeing where they are while drilling</em>, using a mirror to position the drill
first.</p>
<p>Like I said, I have a taste for misery.</p>
<p>So there we went, punching the back side.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Placards - in place</p><p>Wait, wait wait wait. It came <em>off</em>. But it will be held back by the switches' nuts when the switches are in. And.. cover
the holes! That means, I don't need to drill the holes from the back side and worry about punching thru (or not going deep enough) - I can comfortably sit in the cockpit and
drill them from the front! All the way thru! The placard will cover them! In my search for misery, did I luck out?! :)</p>
<p>In retrospect, this (and the opposite side's) placard were probably not glued. No need - switches' nuts hold them just fine.</p>
<p>They were stuck because Remo probably installed them on top of the paint that didn't fully cure - and it just stuck to the backside
of placards over the years, under the pressure from switches' nuts.</p>
<p>I stuck my nail under the opposite side placard, and it came off with a little force.</p>
<p>Ha!</p>
<p>Well, it was smooth sailing from there...</p>

<p>Looking around, looking around.... aha! Here's a number 8 or 10 screw plugging a hole! I can enlarge it and we'll be

<p>Yep. Good luck, buddy. That was an even <em>bigger</em> hole that was plugged with a #8 screw in a countersunk finishing
washer... hmmm... maybe that will work out for the pot too?</p>
<p>You know, drilling a #10 countersunk washer to have a 1/4&quot; hole in it is... hard? Annoying? You can't really grip
it in any manner without damaging it, you can't hold it in your fingers... I think I lucked out on my third try, with combination
of a Unibit and light clamping of that washer in a vice.</p>
<p>With that re-drilled countersunk washer, the pot mounts just fine in hole #2. And #1 got plugged back :).</p>

<h2>Compass Mount</h2>
<p>Well, after all that excitement compass mount was almost anti climactic. I toyed with the idea of putting it into the panel
(and relocating G-meter into a new hole I'd cut around where the ignition switch was - see, after
<a class="reference external" href="http://79ft.net/entries/2019-09-08-fwf-side-channel-panel-layouts/">having failed relocating Hobbs there</a>, the idea of still
making a bigger hole in the panel keeps nagging me :).</p>
<p>No good. When that much down, too much steel around it confuses the compass to the tune of about 30 degrees... No need to
add extra problems in already a magnetically problematic plane.</p>
<p>So, top it was to be. The windshield will get in the way, but I really, really didn't want to take it off (~20 #6
screws and nuts in a tight spot is no fun).</p>
<p>Eyeballed the bracket alignment with the fuselage centerline and put it in the right spot...</p>
<p>Damn! Sharpie's too tall to get in there to mark the holes <em>vertically</em>. &quot;Angle Sharpie Adapter&quot;... hmm..</p>

<hr class="dashed"/><p>I was on the fence about making this entry as multiple separate ones versus just one giant one... After all, it covers
quite a few, mostly unrelated, things that I did in the last few days, and it would've made sense to keep
them separate.</p>
<p>However; finally decided to make just one big article with all of them. None of them are finished; but somewhat a decent
chunk of work is - I think I have <em>mostly</em> figured out where everything will go and how it will all come together.</p>
<p>I guess, what I'm trying to say is, if you clicked on the &quot;Panel Layout&quot; entry in the Log, and are trying to figure out why
are you seeing notes on Firewall Forward, just keep scrolling :).</p>
<div class="section" id="diagram">
<h2>Diagram</h2>
<p>I have updated the electrical diagram, version 2 is <a class="reference external" href="/files/6781G-new-electrical/6781G-wiring-diagram.v2.pdf">here</a>.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Main Connector is gone. I was convinced that reliability concerns outweigh the benefits of having it. Plus, I have very
little precious room to work with.</li>
<li>Physically, it's easier to hook up the LR3C Sense wire to a different spot - on the Shunt stud rather than to the
Master Contactor/Starter Contactor jumper directly. It makes no difference, it's the same circuit - just a different hookup spot to it.</li>
<li>I also fixed some typos, and cleaned up a bit.</li>

<h2>Firewall Forward</h2>
<p>I started trying things around firewall forward while
<a class="reference external" href="http://79ft.net/entries/2019-09-01-carb-cables/">figuring out routing and lengths for carb control cables</a>, and continued
afterwards.</p>
<div class="section" id="contactors-and-beefy-wires">
<h3>Contactors and Beefy Wires</h3>
<div class="section" id="contactors">
<h4>Contactors</h4>
<p>It became obvious fairly quickly that I won't be able to use the nice B&amp;C Starter Contactor because of it's mounting
holes not being the same as a very common SS581 Starter Solenoid that was set up by Remo. Also, the way terminals
were set up on the B&amp;C Starter Contactor would have made them closer to the carb control cables. And, I didn't want to drill more
holes in the firewall.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">SS581 Contactor</p><p>So I decided to go with SS581-style and ordered one from Vans. While waiting for it, I used the old one just to mock
things up.</p>
<p>And because it doesn't have the spike catcher diode, I had to get me a couple IN5400s, and soldered an extension lead to one
of them.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Extension lead</p><p>The other leg will get a crimp ring terminal. I had to do that 'cause the diode leads themselves weren't long enough.</p>

<div class="section" id="battery-and-starter-wires">
<h4>Battery and Starter Wires</h4>
<p>Those are the thickest wires, and routing them is more complicated than the other ones. In addition, the
battery + -&gt; master contactor wire is the only wire that can't be turned off, and therefore needs to be very well
thought out and as short as possible.</p>
<p>Here's something else, too. The Charger was set up to ground the battery to the motor. So far, so good - starter is by far
the largest consumer in the electrical system. However, nothing was done to ground the motor to the rest of the airplane!</p>
<p>So the rest of the system was probably grounded via whatever metal to metal connections there were on the motor.
Control cables and braided fuel and oil hoses? ;) Airbox bowden &quot;carb heat&quot; cable... I can't think of much more else.</p>
<p>Initially, I was planning to run a ground strap braid from the battery negative to one of the bolts holding the battery
box to the firewall, but with fuel system components and control cables around, just couldn't figure out a good way to run
it and support it. I had to end up settling for running it to the engine mount instead.</p>
<p>So the bottom line is, the negative 4GA cable is gonna go to the motor, and parallel to it a braid will go to the motor mount.
I also figured out a clamp arrangement with some standoffs that will keep the wires neat and organized.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Rough component locations</p><p>I had to relocate the bowdens lower to free up some space.  The Oil Cooler box on this plane is all sorts of weird, including a flapper valve controlled by one of those bowdens that closes up the airflow to it (which is not enough to begin with; being a 1.5&quot; SCAT takeoff off of back baffle.. but don't get me started on that). That cable turned out to be too short when
relocated - but I lucked out - Glenn had a bowden going to the Rotec TBI that I removed for &quot;prime&quot; function, and that bowden was plenty
long. I'll trim it to final length when I'm done in that side conduit.</p>
<p>The brake tube was running inside the conduit, and I will have to relocate it to run below the conduit and be supported

Voltage Regulator would've been &quot;upside down&quot;, with terminal strip up.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Upside Down orientation</p><p>Damn you, the yellow sticker on the regulator! DAMN you! (hint: read it :) ).</p>
<p>Mounting it sideways, I'd have a line of rivet heads under it - which I didn't want to deal with.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Sideways orientation</p><p>And mounting it down... Down was annoying because of the clamp for bowdens and bowdens close there. That would also
complicate wiring.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Down orientation</p><p>Upside down would've been perfect... except for that yellow sticker :). So, I decided to Hail Mary and asked nice folks at
B&amp;C about what they thought.</p>
<p>See, the problem is I know why they wanted the terminal strip to be pointed down. It's so that water won't get into the
box in case of condensation accumulating on it. But I thought, maybe I can seal it somehow?</p>
<p>The answer from TJ at B&amp;C was a resounding no. Right side up, sideways - but not upside down.</p>
<p>So I mocked up the right side up mounting...</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-09-08-fwf-side-channel-panel-layouts/cond-12.jpg" title="Right side up mockup" >

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Right side up mockup</p><p>Yuck. Yeah; it'd work; but it's ugly as hell.</p>
<p>The only other option would be sideways, but on &quot;standoffs&quot; of sorts to clear the rivet heads. I mentioned that to TJ, and he
said that that could work, but I should check if I can access the voltage adjustment screw on the top of the box.</p>
<p>Damn it! I forgot about it. On the top of the box there's a plug over a hole that opens up access to a tiny screw to adjust
buss voltage - basically, to fine tune how much volts the battery sees. Not something you do often, but you want to be able
to do it.</p>
<p>But then, TJ mentioned that he saw the holes in the firewall and that might be the saving grace.</p>
<p>Bingo!</p>
<p>I tried it out again in vertical, now with mocked up standoffs</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Vertical</p><p>With just enough aggravation due to bad access (mandatory in aviation pretty much), you can undo the bolt covering the hole
in the firewall (this hole was left over from the brake line relocation), pop the plug on the voltage regulator, and
just have enough access to the adjustment screw.</p>

<p>Hobbs was on the front panel, probably because of space issues on the rear panel.</p>

<p>Well, I had this unsightly hole left over after removing the ignition key switch...</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Unsightly hole</p><p>... and I thought, maybe I could put the Hobbs back there?</p>
<p>My initial tests with one of the  2 1/4 gauges I have removed seemed to have been okay: there was <em>just enough</em> room
in there to get another 2 1/4 gauge in.</p>
<p>So, I got me a very nice panel punch that could make a nice, round, clean hole in place.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-09-08-fwf-side-channel-panel-layouts/punch.jpg" title="Instrument Hole Punch" >

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Instrument Hole Punch</p><p>Well, next was to remove the Hobbs from the front panel. <em>That</em> was an hour of contortionism. The Hobbs is
held by an aluminum backplate and
four nylock nuts, so I <em>had</em> to have a wrench over them the <em>whole</em> time. Oh, the screws are way too long BTW, so taking all
them out took about five times more turns than it should've, while I was wondering if my wrists will take this much
flexing, twisting, and bending any longer.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Mounting ring</p><p>This is a pic from the fuel quantity gauge held in the same manner, but here he's using brass flat type nuts that you can
hold with your fingers. On the Hobbs, it was nylocks.</p>
<p>Anyway, I got it out.  And then, started setting up for punching that hole.
Removed VSI to give me a bit more room to work with.</p>
<p>I tried to reconstruct exactly what happened next in my memory to write it down here, and could not.
I was basically fiddling, checking clearances, making sure I'll be able to hook up the punch and center the hole, have
enough room for the mounting ring in the back and clear everything I had to clear, when I discovered that...</p>
<p>The Hobbs was <em>not</em> a standard 2 1/4 inch gauge - it was a touch <em>bigger</em>. So the hole that I would've made would've been
too small for it. And that if I punched the hole, I would've been just left with a bigger hole and nothing to
put in there.</p>
<p>Damn, damn, damn! Damn you, assumptions that every &quot;small&quot; gauge on an airplane is 2 1/4!</p>
<p>And I had the expensive punch that I had no use for :(.</p>
<p>Oh well. Thanks God I actually did <em>not</em> do it - only to have a <em>larger</em> hole to plug up. I guess, that Hobbs is (thru
more contortionism) going back to the front panel.</p>
<p>As they say, Le Sigh.</p>

<p>It's a bit taller than the whiskey compass, so I'm playing with different mount locations. I think this is what it will be;
with shock isolating rubber pad under the mount where the gap is at the moment.</p>

<hr class="dashed"/><p>Even before Oshkosh, I have decided to replace the Rotec TBI the Charger had when I got it with a good old MA4-SPA carb. In short,
I do not trust the damn thing - especially with it being the sole component providing two out of three vertices
of the proverbial fire triangle to the motor. That reminds me, I need to summarize my thoughts on Rotec...</p>
<p>Regardless, one of the things  I got at Oshkosh was a rebuilt MA4-SPA from Spruce, and it was sitting in the
hangar waiting it's turn. I knew I would need to order new control cables for it, so I decided to get that going, after
all the alternator business was finished, because getting those cables will take me a bit.</p>
<p><em>Here's a fun aside. I knew this motor had a MA4 carb and Glenn &quot;upgraded&quot; it to the Rotec TBI. What I didn't
know was precisely what kind of MA4-SPA it had (and there are quite a few models of that carb).</em></p>
<p><em>No problem. At Oshkosh, I went to nice folks from Tempest (which now owns MA Carbs) and had a very nice conversation with them.
I asked if I should buy the carb from them, and they recommended Spruce instead, because it would be cheaper that way.
And, they mentioned the $600 core charge (I'll spell this out - you must provide a good &quot;core&quot; (old carburetor) or get
charged extra six hundred bucks). Ouch.</em></p>
<p><em>Ha! thought I. I am at Oshkosh! What could be easier than getting an old carburetor, especially since it's one of the
most widespread models? No problem at all!</em></p>
<p><em>Laughing, I ran that by guys from Tempest. They laughed with me, and actually were very very very helpful, telling me
what to look for when picking up an old carb.</em></p>
<p><em>No cracks in the body. Control arms should be present. Threads nice and not torn up. Venturi present. Etc etc etc.</em></p>
<p><em>Well, to the FlyMart we went, and sure enough, on a bench there laid a number of MA4-SPAs present, ranging from
$250 to $450. Of course, I picked up the $250 one (it was yellowtagged by the way! In 1995, if I recall), dragged it
over to Spruce, ordered a new carb, and handed them the old one I just picked up. So, $350 saved in about half a mile
of walking. Not bad!</em></p>
<p>Here it is, in all it's glory, hooked up to my motor. You guys should admire my &quot;economizer design&quot; gasket. Hmm... I need to patent that and start selling them for $100/pop. <em>Your fuel costs will go to 0! Now, you might not be going too far... but..
Fuel costs! Zero! With all the benefits, not going anywhere is such an insig....</em> Ahem.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Carb</p><p>Well, okay. The carb was on, and cables came next.</p>
<p>The Rotec had it's control cables for mixture and throttle done completely differently than the carb. Glenn reused Throttle
cable for Mixture on the TBI - it worked out well. He added a new cable, routed completely differently, for the TBI's
Throttle.</p>
<p>Since this motor was originally carbureted, all I had to do is reverse engineer a bit the way Remo did the hookups.</p>
<p>Hehe.</p>
<p>Well, Throttle on the carb side wasn't that bad.</p>

   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-09-01-carb-cables/c-2-2-thumb.jpg" title="With a Clevis" alt="With a Clevis" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">With a Clevis</p><p>It actually worked out a bit better with a Clevis, having the cable end centered nicely on the throttle arm. So I
decided to do the clevis.</p>
<p>Next was confirming the &quot;throw&quot; - making sure that the throttle control range of motion, whatever it is, is sufficient
(in fact, it must have some extra &quot;padding&quot; in it) to move the throttle stop to stop. Boy, was I in for a treat.</p>
<p>This Charger has <em>reversing</em> throttle quadrants, meaning that when the throttle goes forward,
the actual control is pulled  backward. Since forward on the control must translate into forward on the carburetor, the
Charger has bellcranks to reverse the motion once again. These bellcranks are also a nice spot to tune out the <em>range</em>
of motion.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-09-01-carb-cables/c-3.jpg" title="Control linkage" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-09-01-carb-cables/c-3-thumb.jpg" title="Control linkage" alt="Control linkage" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Control linkage</p><p>See, the relative distance of the top and bottom holes on the bellcrank to it's pivot point &quot;convert&quot; whatever range
of motion is on the control (throttle quadrant) side to an appropriate range of motion on the carburetor side.</p>
<p>And Glenn changed them.</p>
<p>Not a surprise. The Rotec TBI had it's controls set up very differently as compared to a carb. Notice how in the picture
the color of those bellcranks is somewhat off from the rest of the fuselage? That was my first clue...</p>
<p>My second clue was finding one of those bellcrank plates (minus the bearing) in the box of parts that I got with the airplane.</p>
<p>My third clue was me not being able to get the full range on the throttle.</p>
<p>Crap!</p>
<p>I am absolutely not set up to redo the bellcranks. Though they look simple, unless I want to make them from 3/16&quot; steel, which
would make them very, very, VERY heavy, I'd need a TIG welder. Or to MacGyver things with washers. And do quite a lot of
trial and error.</p>
<p>I wanted to see if I could luck out.</p>
<p>Credit goes to Glenn here - he made his new bellcranks <em>perfect</em> for the TBI. The range of motion on them was just right...
for the TBI. Because of that, they were asymmetrical - so I thought; maybe, just <em>maybe</em>, if I was to try them in different
combinations, I would luck out...</p>
<p>And I did!</p>
<p>Now, these two paragraphs of text and one picture is me describing... about 3 or 4 hours of work - tweaking cables,
turning bellcranks, checking, rinsing, and repeating. I think I did find a combination of orientation of these that gave
me <em>acceptable</em> (but by no means perfect) ranges of motion. I think I lost about an inch on both of the controls, but
that's not so bad, after all - you want extra room in your control's range of movement to make absolutely positive
you can move the controlled thing stop to stop.</p>
<p>Okay, Mixture's next.</p>
<p>I hooked up the cable that Glenn used for throttle to the mixture control on the carb, to use as a &quot;mock up&quot;,
and kinda fished it thru.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-09-01-carb-cables/c-1-4.jpg" title="Mixture cable hookup" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-09-01-carb-cables/c-1-4-thumb.jpg" title="Mixture cable hookup" alt="Mixture cable hookup" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Mixture cable hookup</p><p>I had to use a rod end here. The cable wouldn't line up with the control arm on the carb for me to be able to
use a Clevis there.... See how angled and offset that hookup is? I think Remo had a solid bowden cable style control
there...</p>
<p>Another problem with the Mixture control is that the carb's arm has a 1/4&quot; hole.. the rod ends need a #10 screw; which
means that the hole on the carb arm is too large. No biggie though, I'll add a bushing to reduce it.</p>
<p>Yet another problem is that the bolt's head is way too close to the carb bowl, and I had to have it reversed like
that (bolt &quot;upside down&quot;).</p>
<p>There's not a lot of room on the top either. Planning to  fix this problem with using of 1/2
size shear nut, and figuring out the exact bolt length (I ordered every bolt between -4 and -10 sizes).</p>
<p>And now, the routing of those cables.</p>
<p>The throttle cable routing was a given. I did not like too tight a radius in one of it's &quot;turns&quot;.</p>
<p>I wanted to try to optimize the routing..... ha. Good luck there buddy! The battery box gets in the way (the battery is
in a completely wrong place on this plane... it's reversed with the oil cooler. Oil cooler should be on the left. Battery
on the right. This makes controls routing a breeze. But no.....).</p>
<p>I wanted to make sure to keep the mixture cable to not be too close to the beefy 4 AWG cable that will go from
the battery to the master relay.</p>
<p>I had to reverse engineer previous routing of the cable, and figure out the best points to hook it up to the firewall.</p>
<p>I wanted to have my ANL fuse bases close to the master and starter relay. Ha! No way, with the control cables
the way they would have to be.</p>
<p>All this was an exercise in misery, and lots and lots of time. I wanted too much.</p>
<p>In the end, the routing of the throttle will stay the same; the cable will just be shortened to make one of the
turn radiusii bigger. The mixture will go nearby, and curl around the battery box.</p>
<p>I will not be able to use any other arrangement of solenoids and will have to stick to the old one. What's worse,
I will not be able to use the new solenoid I got from B&amp;C - it's mounting holes are very different, and, frankly,
it's not worth it to drill more holes in already a sieve-like firewall - I'll stick with the classic &quot;style&quot;.</p>

away from the firewall and clamped to a couple of points I found.</p>

<p>More bad news? I long noticed a leak from the left brake bleeder valve; and decided to add a new valve to my next order from Spruce.
I thought it was a basic valve problem. Well,  went to look for it's dimensions, and found out the source of the damn
leak, actually... Looks like someone tried to fix a leak there by making a bigger leak. The fun thing was, I didn't notice
this before - the brake was too dirty...</p>

<hr class="dashed"/><p>With <a class="reference external" href="http://79ft.net/entries/2019-08-25-alternator-baffle-support-bracket/">baffle support bracket</a> done, the next
step on the path to alternator happiness was the pivot arm.</p>
<div class="section" id="the-problem">
<h2>The Problem</h2>
<p>... was that the default B&amp;C's pivot arm did interfere with the front baffle  hookup brackets.</p>

<p>Well, this bracket did not involve any bending, just needed to make the correct one to fit around all the other
stuff there on the nose.</p>
<p>Hmm... so how do we do that? Well, first, we need...</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-template">
<h2>The Template</h2>
<p>This is not the real template, because (.. read on ;) ). It's the template for the Template.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Cut around the alternator</p><p>All we need to do with this template is show the location of the hookup hole (top hole, the one that attaches the

<p>Okay. I'm lying to you. This template is not the one I used. It was done with the long belt that ended up not working out,
so I had to redo the template (thanks God, just the template). The new one was done in the same manner as the one I described
above.</p>
<p>Here it is:</p>

</div>
<div class="section" id="solidworks">
<h2>Solidworks!</h2>
<p>It's magic, I keep telling people.</p>
<p>So, we take our  template, and scan it on a scanner, along with a little metal ruler to give us physical dimensions. Then, we go to Solidworks, start a sketch, and insert the scan as &quot;sketch picture&quot;. Using the image of the ruler <em>that was scanned in</em>, we tell Solidworks what &quot;one inch&quot; on this picture is. Boom! The image is now dimensionally accurate.</p>
<p>Then, we start drawing around it.</p>

   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-08-31-alternator-pivot-arm/b-8-thumb.jpg" title="Initial sketch" alt="Initial sketch" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Initial sketch</p><p>Above, I positioned the top hole, and the four 5/16&quot; holes around bolt imprints. I then sketched a large circle and made it <em>tangent</em> to three out of four of those holes - it defines the &quot;pivot arc&quot;. Then, offsetting it 5/16th gives me the other &quot;side&quot; of the slot; and offsetting it more gives me the &quot;sides&quot; of the bracket in the &quot;pivot arc&quot; area.</p>
<p>I also started sketching the &quot;no go&quot; lines around the top portion of the bracket.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-08-31-alternator-pivot-arm/b-9.jpg" title="More circles" >

You can almost see the outline of the pivot arm, yes? ;)</p>
<p>Now, we take this master sketch; and add arc elements with real lines that we care about.</p>

<p>Next, we print the drawing of our new part; making sure our holes' centers are marked (we'll use that later to drill
them)</p>

<hr class="dashed"/><p>As I have <a class="reference external" href="http://79ft.net/entries/2019-08-16-alternator-fitting/">thought before</a>, I would need the new nose baffle
support bracket, to replace this one:</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Gap between starter boss and alternator bracket</p><p>See that gap between the starter boss &quot;ear&quot; and the new alternator bracket?</p>
<p>Hmmm, methinks.. Maybe, maybe, I can get away without bending up a new, 0.090 steel bracket with weird geometry (it's
not a simple &quot;couple bends and you're done&quot; - you'll see later).</p>
<p>Well, let's see.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-08-25-alternator-baffle-support-bracket/b-2.jpg" title="Old bracket fits nicely in that gap" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-08-25-alternator-baffle-support-bracket/b-2-thumb.jpg" title="Old bracket fits nicely in that gap" alt="Old bracket fits nicely in that gap" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Old bracket fits nicely in that gap</p><p>But it was <em>just a touch</em> too &quot;low&quot;. Didn't fit right - and I couldn't raise it (that would raise the holes to which
the nose baffle itself attaches, and make the whole thing just not work).</p>
<p>Oh well, I guess we're bending steel after all.</p>
<p>Around that time, my strip  of 4130 I ordered from Spruce some days back showed up.</p>
<p>I needed a vice, and a couple more pieces of steel for bending block and such. Picked those up at big box stores
(and I will admit, that included a trip to Harbor Freight..).</p>
<p>I also fished out my old small belt sander, and air grinder, from the storage (all my tools are packed up aside
from simple hand tools - I am rebuilding my shop; and thanks God I had them close so that I didn't have to rummage thru boxes).</p>
<p>Cutting off a small chunk of an approx. 1/4&quot; thick strip for a bending block is no joke...</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">... Cutting</p><p>My compressor would run out of air, and I'd have to stop, and, while waiting for it to get back to pressure, use hacksaw ('cause
I didn't have anything better to do).</p>
<p>Then, I attempted to get away with shoddy bevel grind on the bending block...</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-08-25-alternator-baffle-support-bracket/b-5.jpg" title="Very poorly made bending block" >

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Very poorly made bending block</p><p>I hoped that that little &quot;cavity&quot; in the middle would work enough to handle bending spring-back - the roundover was fine, just
the bevel was uneven.</p>
<p>Ha! Bending a couple of test bends proved me wrong; and that one never gets away with shoddy workmanship.</p>
<p>I re-ground the block to have a nice, even section (all that on a 1x30 belt sander by the way - which I have discovered is perfectly adequate for handling steel with a ~40 grit belt).</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-08-25-alternator-baffle-support-bracket/b-10.jpg" title="A much better bending block" >

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Edge to be cleaned up</p><p>I kinda gave up on it, frankly - got too tired to get it straight and even; and decided to temporarily switch my mind to something
else.</p>
<p>Instead, I cut another, test strip, of 4130, without making it to proper width - and attempted to replicate the bracket's geometry
on the now much better bending block.</p>
<p>Thinking about how to replicate bend lines, I couldn't think of anything better than... just roughly folding a piece of paper
over the old bracket.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Old bracket, test bend, paper pattern, and strip prepared for the new bracket</p><p>It worked!</p>
<p>The key was, rather than bending the strip over the block by hand, instead, start the bend by hand, and
then finish it with the hammer. I used another piece of 1/4 strip that I cleaned up as an &quot;interface&quot; between the hammer and
the material bent, to avoid hammer marks. This way, the bend was much tighter radius (equal to about material thickness, which is what you need for steel), and much easier to control and nudge in the proper direction.</p>
<p>The geometry of the bracket was close enough; the angles were off a bit, but those could be tweaked.</p>
<p>All that bending was one day. I felt done, and left.</p>
<p>Next time I was over at the hangar, I thought, &quot;to hell with it&quot;, and decided to use my real strip that I cut out for final bracket.</p>
<p>Used a nice square to draw a reference line, and cleaned up and straightened that edge left  over from cutting, marked the first bend line using the paper template left over from my test bend:</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Bend two</p><p>See the problem? Yep, the first bend is not right on the mark - I did not clamp it right for that first bend. No problem though,
I had enough spare length on both ends, so I just moved the location of the second bend accordingly.</p>

<p>But for that, we need to position the baffle, and then mark out the holes.</p>
<p>No problem.</p>
<p>Bolt on the old bracket, and hook up the baffle to it. Use anything, whatever, for reference (I used the starter conveniently sticking thru the baffle):</p>

Golden Lindy ;) ).</p>
<p>I guess I'm keeping mine.</p>
<p>I pulled out my nice Cobalt bits I got at Oshkosh to make those holes. At that point I have obtained an old small drill
press for the hangar (I had to drill the first, large, hole in the &quot;ear&quot; free hand - even with Unibit that was very annoying).</p>

<p>By the way - you must say - but it's just two bends! How come your holes are not lining up nicely, and such?</p>
<p>Well, this thing has a very messed up geometry. It's two bends, at a non-even angle. This picture probably illustrates this best:</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Geometry</p><p>Meanwhile, I also had to figure out the alternator's belt length - to make sure it clears all the brackets, and holes in the
nose baffle.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://79ft.net/entries/2019-08-16-alternator-fitting/">I wrote a bit about it in the previous post</a>. Initially I thought that
just mocking up the belt, measuring the length of the mockup, and ordering the right size would work - ha!</p>
<p>New belt was too long, and didn't clear the newly made bracket.</p>
<p>Ooookay. Well, I had the belt that's too long (the one I ordered after making the mockup of belt length with a chunk of wire).
And, I had the belt that was too short (the one that came with the alternator).</p>
<p>So, I bought <em>all the sizes in between</em>.</p>

to discover that the nose baffle  was sticking out, or not fitting in any other way, when putting the cowling back on.</p>

<hr class="dashed"/><p>So most orders have been placed, and a lot of them have arrived already. (Note to self: need to take pictures of all the stuff).</p>
<p>The first thing to be worked on is the heart - the alternator.</p>
<p>Look at this little beauty!</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-08-16-alternator-fitting/a-1.jpg" title="B&C L-40" >

 </a> <p class="small text-center">B&C L-40</p><p>Tiny, light as a feather, and cute as a button! No, sir, this thing has to get attached to the nose!</p>
<p>The old one needs to come off. Pivot arm bolt undone. Pivot bold undone.</p>
<p>Wait. The pivot bolt can't get out, because the flywheel gets in the way...</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-08-16-alternator-fitting/a-4.jpg" title="Pivot bolt and interference" >

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Pivot bolt and interference</p><p>Hmm.. No, I can't believe Remo pulled the flywheel off of crank just to install the alternator. There must be a better
way.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-08-16-alternator-fitting/a-6.jpg" title="The better way - bracket attach bolts!" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-08-16-alternator-fitting/a-6-thumb.jpg" title="The better way - bracket attach bolts!" alt="The better way - bracket attach bolts!" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">The better way - bracket attach bolts!</p><p>Aha! This is case mount, and the bracket is attached to the motor case. Let's see... Yep! It came off.</p>
<p>Now, the new bracket... centers nicely!</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-08-16-alternator-fitting/a-8.jpg" title="New bracket" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-08-16-alternator-fitting/a-8-thumb.jpg" title="New bracket" alt="New bracket" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">New bracket</p><p>See that ear on the right, that touches the starter boss? That one needs to attach to the starter, to prevent
the bracket flexing left and right. It lines up great, but, problem number one (but I knew this one), the old
alternator bracket didn't have that. Remo used that hole on the starter boss to hook up the front of the nose &quot;ramp&quot; part of
the baffle:</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-08-16-alternator-fitting/a-2.jpg" title="Baffle attach bracket" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-08-16-alternator-fitting/a-2-thumb.jpg" title="Baffle attach bracket" alt="Baffle attach bracket" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Baffle attach bracket</p><p>No matter. I will just bend up a new one, to account for the thickness of the new bracket's &quot;ear&quot; that will get sandwiched
between this baffle attach bracket, and the starter boss. Material already ordered!</p>
<p>Now, let's test fit the belt, and the new pivot arm. The belt, the belt.. oh wait. Yep. The prop needs to come off - but this
is a non-event now (and I am not leaving the prop off again -
<a class="reference external" href="http://79ft.net/entries/2019-05-17-race-for-the-engine/">learned that one already</a>). I'm becoming quite good at
this prop pulling business....</p>
<p>Belt on and prop back on, test-fitting the pivot arm... CRUD!</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-08-16-alternator-fitting/a-10.jpg" title="Pivot arm" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-08-16-alternator-fitting/a-10-thumb.jpg" title="Pivot arm" alt="Pivot arm" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Pivot arm</p><p>That black bracket to the left of it holds the hose &quot;ramp&quot; portion of the baffle..... and, it won't let the damn pivot
arm go in! No way. And no easy modification here - it's interfering, seriously...</p>
<p>Frankly, at that point I went home (this whole note covers quite a few days of work), with thoughts of remaking the
front baffle; and spent the evening researching how baffles are done on planes with similar nosebowl... Frankly,
I don't like how this front baffle is done on this plane (see
<a class="reference external" href="http://79ft.net/entries/2019-05-17-cowling-conundrum/">Cowling Conundrum</a>), and thought of this as being a good
chance to fix it. I moaned about this to my buddy and colleague Dima D (who's helping me here quite a lot with notes
and advice)...</p>
<p>But next nite, I thought that maybe I can get away with remaking just the arm... I am absolutely not set up to do complicated
sheet metal work at the moment...</p>
<p>The old alternator had this weird pivot arm that now made way more sense. It &quot;doglegged&quot; around the bracket with which
the standard pivot arm interfered:</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-08-16-alternator-fitting/a-11.jpg" title="The old pivot arm" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-08-16-alternator-fitting/a-11-thumb.jpg" title="The old pivot arm" alt="The old pivot arm" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">The old pivot arm</p><p>Notice how it has this portion that goes down, and then the pivot arm &quot;turns&quot; left to go under the nose baffle ramp attach
bracket?</p>
<p>That corner is definitely a large stress riser... but this arm held a much heavier Delco-Remy alternator for almost 40 years...
Granted, it's made out of 0.190 steel as opposed to 0.125 steel used in B&amp;C bracket... but I can make a similar one for
the new alternator...</p>
<p>We'll see if we can smooth out that corner so that it's arcing better, reducing stress. If I can, I will use 0.125 steel.
If I can't, I'll settle with 0.190 - just like the old one. We know this works.</p>
<p>Thanks Dima! You were right. For now. I will redo this nose ramp when I'm redoing the motor, later :).</p>
<p>... and now, to the belt. Let's get this nose ramp back on. It has an opening for the belt to pass thru, and a fairing
for the alternator pulley....</p>
<p>Damn. Yep. That one doesn't fit right, either.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-08-16-alternator-fitting/a-13.jpg" title="Nose ramp back on" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-08-16-alternator-fitting/a-13-thumb.jpg" title="Nose ramp back on" alt="Nose ramp back on" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Nose ramp back on</p><p>If you look real careful inside the red circle, you can just see the belt there. It will rub on the left edge of that hole.
It has to go right, which means the alternator has to go down, which means longer belt.</p>
<p>I used a piece of wire to mock this up. Here are a couple of pictures from the back side.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Wire mocking up a longer belt - so that it's centered in the hole</p><p>I ordered a couple of longer belts from the same series, to try them out and see how they will work in the end...</p>
<p>So, where are we at?</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>I will need a new, smaller, bracket for the front support of that nose baffle ramp (the bracket will attach to the starter, same place as before)</li>
<li>I will need to design and make a new pivot arm - and to learn how to make nice slots with hand tools</li>
<li>A different belt</li>
</ul>
<p>Meanwhile, folks at B&amp;C were extremely helpful and generous with their time, reading my long, ranty, emails, and responding
to me with their thoughts. I really appreciated that!</p>

<hr class="dashed"/><p>So this was quite an effort - not because it was a sophisticated design, but rather because it took quite a bit of time
to lay out in a reasonable fashion...</p>
<p>Oh, and also, somewhere in between I had a break for Oshkosh and a work trip :).</p>
<p>I decided to post this in a form of design notes, so that I can go around asking people what they think...</p>
<div class="section" id="the-new-wiring-diagram">
<h2>The New Wiring Diagram</h2>
<p>I have posted it <a class="reference external" href="/files/6781G-new-electrical/6781G-wiring-diagram.pdf">in PDF over here</a>.</p>
<p>Wire length / drop / load calculations are in the <a class="reference external" href="/files/6781G-new-electrical/6781G-wiring-load-schedule.xlsx">Excel spreadhseet over here</a>.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The design is based on Figure Z-11 from AeroElectric Connection by Bob Nuckolls, with the following tweaks:<ul>
<li>I'm using the B&amp;C LR3C Voltage Regulator, so it's wiring has been incorporated</li>
<li>I dropped the Endurance and Main Battery busses</li>
<li>I have tweaked the starting switches circuit, main buss feeder, and how ammeter is hooked up - see below for discussion</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The diagram is laid out to generally clump the components together as they would be on the airplane. It initially might seem
convoluted - but it has a certain flow to it matching the locations of components. Start in bottom right corner for
battery/starter/alternator circuitry and go counter clockwise - this will effectively take you &quot;thru the airplane&quot; as
the components will be laid out; roughly</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="review-items-and-commentary-on-specifics">
<h2>Review Items and Commentary on Specifics</h2>
<div class="section" id="starter-circuitry">
<h3>Starter Circuitry</h3>
<p>My current take on my Starter and Mags circuitry is this:</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-08-11-design-v1/starting-circuit.gif" title="Starting and Mags Circuit" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-08-11-design-v1/starting-circuit.gif" title="Starting and Mags Circuit" alt="Starting and Mags Circuit" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Starting and Mags Circuit</p><p>This is a deviation from Z-11, with both switches having to be in the momentary up position for starter to engage. I like
this better for two reasons:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>It makes the act of starting the motor more explicit</li>
<li>It returns back to correct &quot;running&quot; position automatically</li>
</ul>
<p>I need to test the ergonomics of pressing up a couple switches together. If I don't like it, another alternative would be
to replace the &quot;Right Mag&quot; switch circuitry from -5 to -1: making the top position on it non-momentary (as noted on the diagram).
This will reduce the &quot;user-friendliness&quot; but will still keep the explicitness, especially with my using pull-to-unlock switches
from Honeywell.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="main-power-distribution">
<h3>Main Power Distribution</h3>
<p>The Charging and Buss circuitry excerpt below:</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-08-11-design-v1/power-distribution.gif" title="Power Distribution" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-08-11-design-v1/power-distribution.gif" title="Power Distribution" alt="Power Distribution" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Power Distribution</p><p>Note that:</p>
<p>Shunt is set up to be in the &quot;battery&quot; lead. I like &quot;battery lead&quot; style ammeters, showing charge current on the 12-o-clock-plus
segment, and discharge current on the 12-o-clock-minus segment.</p>
<p>Note that the buss feeder wire is protected by a slow-burn 35A current limiter. In Z-11, that wire is not protected at all. My
reasoning for this decision is that this wire is relatively long on my plane (around 4 feet), since fuse block is near the
rear cockpit. I wanted to protect it.</p>
<p>One area of concern here is that in the event of alternator short, the Ammeter Shunt will be a part of the alternator circuit that
will see a lot of current while the 40A slow burn opens up. My gutfeel says it should be able to handle it, but I am not sure. At
any rate, figure Z-11 has the same setup with shunt on the alternator's B-Lead.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="voltage-regulator-sense-wire">
<h3>Voltage Regulator Sense Wire</h3>
<p>LR3C Voltage Regulator needs a separate &quot;voltage sense&quot; wire that one would normally connect to the main buss. Since the
regulator in my case is closer to the firewall than to the buss (fuse) block, I am connecting it to the main battery
circuitry (jumper wire between Starter and Master contactors). This is somewhat a shorter run and seems that it will be
more logical to measure as close to the battery as possible (especially since I'm saving on wire lengths this way).
Seems sensible to me.</p>
<p>The sense wire will be 20 AWG, about 3' long, and connected via 24 AWG fuselink.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="voltage-regulator-field-supply-circuit">
<h3>Voltage Regulator Field Supply Circuit</h3>
<p>The circuit looks like this:</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-08-11-design-v1/field-supply.gif" title="Field Supply Circuit" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-08-11-design-v1/field-supply.gif" title="Field Supply Circuit" alt="Field Supply Circuit" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Field Supply Circuit</p><p>I copied the AeroElectric's figure Z-11 wire gauges here. In Z-11, everything upstream of Breaker is 18 AWG, and everything
downstream is 20 AWG, but it's not explained why.</p>
<p>Is this driven by a requirement to ensure that fuselink survives the short in the circuit in case of crowbaring, and the
breaker pops first, w/o endangering the fuselink much (18 AWG allows for 22 AWG fuselink instead of 24 AWG)?</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="components-location-and-main-connector">
<h3>Components Location and Main Connector</h3>
<p>Here's a relative diagram of components location, that is necessary for explaining what Main Connector is. Click it for larger
version.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-08-11-design-v1/component-locations.jpg" title="Key component locations" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-08-11-design-v1/component-locations-thumb.jpg" title="Key component locations" alt="Key component locations" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Key component locations</p><p>Note that logically, the way one would wire this airplane would be to pre-wire switches and other items that go into the
pilot's (back) instrument panel with long pigtails, then install the switches, and tie down wiring behind the panel. Then,
the pigtails can be connected to fuse block and loads.</p>
<p>Some of the load wires already exist (lighting for example), and they will have to be spliced to wires coming from switches.</p>
<p>I have decided instead to locate a kind of &quot;Main Connector&quot;  right there near the Fuse
Block. A wire comes off of the Fuse Block, goes to the switch on the panel, then switched power
is returned to the &quot;Main Connector&quot;. Load is on the other side of Main Connector.</p>
<p>This serves a couple purposes:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Create a logical &quot;access point&quot; into the main wire bundle, for reading labels, tracing wires later, and such</li>
<li>Simplify installation process</li>
<li>Connect to existing load wires that are not being replaced</li>
</ul>
<p>For now, I am thinking about using Molex 0.093 pins in two housings (I have 13 circuits total to connect via this thing,
and want to have room for further expansion). I would love suggestions here. One of the requirements is that it should be
easily workable with a multimeter for tracing / testing purposes (I technically could've used  D-Sub here , but am
not due to this precise reason).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="separate-switch-for-turn-and-bank">
<h3>Separate Switch for Turn and Bank</h3>
<p>Yes, it's weird to have that. The original electrical had it. I guess, the logic was to be able to shed half an amp
of unnecessary load in the event of alternator failure, or it was just done for no good reason.</p>
<p>I'm keeping it :).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="front-panel-tach">
<h3>Front Panel Tach</h3>
<p>It's a <a class="reference external" href="http://www.westach.com/instructions/Y2AT3-2.jpg">Westach gauge</a> that feeds off of a magneto P-Lead.
No separate power going to it.</p>
<p>Westach asks for a 1/4 A inline fuse. But why? Seems unnecessary (we don't need to fuse P-Leads).</p>
<p>Wire going to this tach in my opinion need to be shielded P-Lead wire. Not sure if I'm correct here.</p>
<p>I need to tie into one of the P-Leads. I have three options:</p>
<p><strong>At magneto</strong>: I will effectively have two P-Leads coming off of one of them. I have Bendix mags, and connectors on those
might make the whole hookup look ugly. Adds extra wire.</p>
<p><strong>At mag switch in the rear panel</strong>: just adds extra ~4 feet of wire for no reason.</p>
<p><strong>Y-Split the P-lead as it goes along the fuselage</strong>: this seems the most optimal wire-management wise, but I am not sure if
splicing into a P-lead is kosher. I don't see any good reasons why that would be bad, but I don't know everything.
This will likely be a soldered splice unless I find or someone suggests something better. This is my solution of choice at the
moment.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="panel-lighting">
<h3>Panel Lighting</h3>
<p>I am on the fence on this one. On one hand, I can add a nice LED strip light and dimmer to light the panel up.</p>
<p>On the other hand, this is extra weight, and &quot;this is a biplane! you won't fly it at night!&quot; vs. &quot;well what if you find
yourself out late&quot; keeps nagging me. Note: I do <em>not</em> have a landing light (though in a biplane... that's somewhat
a non-necessity ;) ).</p>
<p>I am leaning towards doing it, because doing it now will be easy, and I will have the option to see my gauges at night, even
if that Dark and Stormy Night will be a result of bad planning rather than an intentional thing.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="awg-feeder-for-radios">
<h3>10 AWG Feeder for Radios</h3>
<p>Radio stack was wired via the &quot;Radio Master&quot; switch prior. I was initially going to run separate power feeds to each of the
things in the radio stack, but to get to it, I'll need to pull the wings off (yeah...). It's in between pilot's legs attached
to the bottom of the cockpit.</p>
<p>So, the feeder is staying. The stack has been wired by previous owner recently, and isn't wired badly - with individual fuses
for each radio, and a 10 AWG feeder to it and ground &quot;return&quot; from it.</p>
<p>I'm just putting this &quot;hose&quot; on a 30A fuse, which is more than enough to protect the wire and support all the loads from that
stack.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="strobe-and-nav-on-the-same-circuit">
<h3>Strobe and Nav on the Same Circuit</h3>
<p>I am replacing (TailNav, WingNav) + (old heavy strobe on belly) with <a class="reference external" href="https://uavionix.com/products/skybeacon/">SkyBeacon</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://uavionix.com/products/skysensor/">SkySensor</a> on wingtips and nav/strobe on the tail, but I don't have enough
wiring in the fuselage and wings to have a separate circuit for  strobes. I do not plan to fly IFR (biplane!) so &quot;strobes in
the clouds&quot; is not really an issue. When I will have the rag off the airplane, I will add a separate switching circuit
for just the strobes.</p>
