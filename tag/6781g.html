<hr class="dashed"/><p>Well, damn. With almost a year (no, more than a year!) of my being a caretaker of the Chickenhouse Charger, I
finally was about to actually begin what I have started - which was, putting in <em>my</em> wires.</p>
<p>I decided to start at the switches, and run from the panel forward. Some wires will terminate at the fuse blocks
(power feeds), and some will go forward - to the front panel, voltage regulator, and firewall forward.</p>
<p>Then, I was planning to run a few wires backwards - the ones that were pre-terminated on my transducers (fuel,
oil pressures, oil temp, and mag pickup for the tach).</p>
<p>Immediately, I will admit: <strong>that was a mistake</strong>. While the harness turned out alright, it could've been
much neater - if I ran in one direction. I could've made sure the whole thing is wire to wire and perfectly
clean. So I should've run front to back, because my pre-terminated wires all &quot;started&quot; upfront.</p>
<p>In other words, prop to tail. Well sigh. Next time. On the other hand, this approach would've made terminating
switches at the panel a nightmare. That was, initially, the reason why I wanted to start at the panel - so that
I'd pre-attach wires to switches, tie them up, and then trim them at the other end.</p>
<p>At any rate.... Shall we?</p>
<div class="section" id="prep">
<h2>Prep</h2>
<p>Couple things to knock off before I started wiring was to complete the back panel. One thing that was
left was the compass correction card bracket. No problem, drilled and tapped a couple holes for #2 brass screws.</p>
<p>Here's Mr. M. installing it:</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Compass Correction Card Bracket</p><p>The other one was the inertia switch for the smoke system. Glenn had it in for &quot;safety&quot;: in the event of a
shock (crash?) the switch breaks the circuit. I am.. not sure why he would have it, but he had it.</p>
<p>I considered not putting it back in, but what the hell.</p>
<p>Here's the switch:</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Shock switch</p><p>The problem was, it sat tightly between other switches in the panel. With old layout, that barely worked; but with
the new layout, and Honeywell double throw switches, the connector plug was getting in the way. So I had to resort
to some vandalism. :)</p>

<h2>Panel</h2>
<p>Now ready, I decided to install the switches first, and then wire them from the back. I needed a couple short jumpers
though to connect them, and to set up some wires to be the exact length. That'd be impossible with switches
installed in the panel (too little access), so I set up an old placard plate, installed switches into it,
and worked on those jumpers and terminations on the bench before moving them to the airplane.</p>

support than the typical PIDG crimp used everywhere.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Somewhere in the middle of running the wires</p><p>I think it happened when I was yet again sitting in the cockpit, clicking the switches and enjoying the very
well done Honeywell's action.....</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Engine starter engaged position - note that I can hit the starter and hold the throttle with the same hand</p><p>...when it dawned on me...</p>
<p>My three most important switches, L and R Mags, and Master, were set up with lockouts - you couldn't turn them on
just by clicking them, instead, having to pull the lever first to move it to the &quot;on&quot; position. I mostly
did that to protect from accidental too playful a kid in the cockpit.</p>
<p>But they weren't locked out in the &quot;on&quot; position!</p>
<p>Why is that important? Well, the Smoke and the Fuel Pump - the most <em>operated</em> switches on this plane - are
right there. Note how their levers are shorter? If I accidentally hit the longer levered Master, or a Mag, switch,
that would turn it <em>off</em> - with me potentially shutting down the motor. While a remote possibility, improving
the situation would amount to just replacing the switches to the ones with lockouts in <em>both</em> on <em>and</em> off positions.</p>
<p>I don't know how I missed that when designing the original setup...</p>
<p>I decided to do it.</p>
<p>So out came the switches, I had to un-wire the terminals from the back. In went the order for three new
switches with now correct lock-outs.</p>
<p>About a week later, I had them, and could proceed.</p>
<p>With left side wired up, I could tie it down. Mind you, access there is tight and from all kinds of
weird angles :).</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Extreme Soldering</p><p>For those lighting wires, and for the turn coordinator, routing took some fiddling with. My initial plan would've
had them rubbing against the sides of the gauges, and I decided to bring them &quot;out&quot; and away - that's why I had to
extend them, by the way.</p>

<p>The right side of the panel was much easier - it held much smaller, and simpler circuits, for lights and turn
and bank.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Right side</p><p>You can see the beginnings of the ground strap to bond the panel with the &quot;side conduit&quot;, holding the fuse
blocks and being one of the grounding points. In my <a class="reference external" href="http://79ft.net/entries/2019-08-11-design-v1/">original design</a>,
I had firewall, motor, &quot;side conduit&quot;, and panel, as ground points - all bonded with those straps.</p>
<p>Here's the right side:</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2020-07-26-wiring-1/w-59.jpg" title="Right side" >

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Panel bonding strap</p><p>(the bonding strap got enclosed in super flexible heatshrink just for neatness: this is a fit-up picture).</p>
<p>I also had some fun with ADELs right where the wires turn from the &quot;side conduit&quot; towards the panel.
I had to clear and negotiate a couple bowdens, and the engine monitor harness was unwieldy.</p>
<p>I think that took a number of hours, just trying various setups, the final one that I really liked was this:</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Engine monitor and carb heat bowden.</p><p>I replaced all the ugly zipties with lacing, of course :).</p>
<p>Meanwhile, on the outside, to keep the wires nicely separated, I spread them out in kind of a &quot;fan&quot; in the order
they ran, back to front:</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2020-07-26-wiring-1/w-44.jpg" title="Wire fan" >

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Wire fan</p><p>A day later, I replaced the tape with a comb. Yep, a cheapo $1 comb :) Worked out great.</p>
<p>And finally, before committing and continuing, I checked each wire for gauge, and proper circuitry.</p>

<h2>Side Contuit, Part I</h2>
<p>With all those wires sticking out, it was now time to start figuring out routing in the side conduit. All the wires
that had to go forward had, well, to go forward.</p>
<p>After lots of fiddling, I ended up with this:</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Initial stab at the side conduit routing</p><p>I had to clear all the brackets, and other sharp things. Ended up adding a couple more ADELs (and drilling holes
in the conduit to accommodate). Also, reused some existing holes, made a few standoffs for ADELs and such.</p>

<div class="section" id="front-panel">
<h2>Front Panel</h2>
<p>The most interesting piece in it was a Westach tach, that fed directly off of a P-Lead and required a .25A
fuse. Glenn used a 1A classic glass fuse, but I decided to do it right. See, the thing is, if it fails &quot;short
circuit&quot;, that'd turn off the mag - I guess that's why the fuse is in there.</p>
<p>The tach would get another 20GA shielded wire, just like a p-lead, and I decided to join it to right mag's
p-lead at the magneto - instead of splicing it into the p-lead running front to back in the side conduit.</p>
<p>But, back to the fuse. I figured, I'd build it into my connector that hooks up to the tach. Then, if blown,
the connector could be rebuilt. Yep, it's more annoying than a regular replaceable fuse, but that circuit is
not critical, and I had no room for a &quot;regular&quot; fuse block or holder.</p>
<p>So I got me a &quot;legged&quot; .25A fuse with a massive voltage rating (I forget what it was, but definitely above
what a mag makes), and hooked it to a regular Molex pin.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">On the tach</p><p>The lead is just a regular pigtailed P-lead, of course. Notice how I like using SCL around individual Molex pins
for added strain relief - that's because I can't produce good Molex crimps that I like; and I end up post-soldering
them in addition to crimping. That strain relief ensures that soldered joint is firmly held immobile. Takes a bit
of extra time, but I actually like that better than straight Molex crimps.</p>
<p>The rest of the front panel wasn't interesting, just annoying. There's only three circuits there: nav lights wires
from the left wing run along the back of the panel to the right side where the conduit is, and then there's hobbs
and tach, and that's it. It was just very annoying: with very little access, not being able to see things,
and, being in the front hole, having to climb out and in every time I needed a tool I forgot to put close (when
in the back hole, I can roll up a cart to it and have all my tools there).</p>
<p>Mirror was absolutely required.</p>

<p>Okay, so the front  panel got done, and it's wires merged with the main harness.</p>

<h2>Firewall Forward</h2>
<p>The final set of wires to join the main harness were all the wires coming from the firewall side - mainly,
transducers and other instrumentation wires, but also a couple wires for the voltage regulator.</p>
<p>This was precisely when I realized the mistake I talked about in the beginning - and ended up with less
neat, and more tortured harness. Oh well.</p>
<p>I started up front, trimming and terminating my fat wires for the starter and alternator B-feed. Some more extreme
soldering (to cap them), this time with a torch.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2020-07-26-wiring-1/w-77.jpg" title="More extreme soldering" >

 </a> <p class="small text-center">More extreme soldering</p><p>I tied up, and clamped the fat bundle to the motor: and apparently, didn't take a single picture.</p>
<p>Then, I had to figure out the diode for the Starter contactor - first of, it needed longer leads. There, instead
of soldering, I used small barrel crimps from Molex along with heatshrink (I do use them where soldering is
impractical, and I decided not to have soldered joints FWF).</p>

<p>I <a class="reference external" href="http://79ft.net/entries/2019-06-18-fuselinks/">tested them a while back</a>, and am confident they'll work.</p>
<p>First, we take a wire 4 &quot;gauge steps&quot; thinner than the fused one (so 24GA for 20GA fused, etc). That goes
into the &quot;source&quot; terminal.</p>

them later.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="tail-light">
<h2>Tail Light</h2>
<p>I got rid of the belly strobe on the plane, because it was too heavy and too.. useless. Wingtip lights are gonna be the SkyBeacon
and SkySensor from uAvionix (my ADSB mandate compliance :) ), and they have strobes: but they're not visible from the back. So
I decided to replace the tail nav light with an LED nav/strobe.</p>
<p>Problem number one: no ground wire going to the tail light. For whatever reason, Remo decided to basically use the fact that the
tail light is hooked up to the rudder with a pair of screws thru sheet metal of the rear rudder bow... I don't even want to begin to think what
the ground path would be: hinges? control cables?</p>
<p>So, I needed a second wire.</p>
<p>Problem number two: it had to be one neat cable, and it had to be of a smallish diameter (Remo had an old 20GA wire, which is thicker
than modern 20GA tefzel wire).</p>
<p>I decided to use a chunk of  20GA shielded - same ones I used for p-leads. Technically I guess you're not supposed to do that, but it's
very far from all the antennas and I'm crossing my fingers that it won't create too much problems. Thickness was spot on.</p>
<p>So, I soldered the new piece to the old wire, and fished it thru using old wire as a pull. That part was scary - if that didn't
work, I would've had to cut holes in the rudder to get a new wire thru.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">All hooked up!</p><p>On the other end (on the tail fin side) the wire went into a hole on the inspection cover, and had to join the wire coming from the front.
And I had to have the ground there. You can see that area right behind the elevator on the &quot;fishing wire thru&quot; picture.</p>
<p>Problem number three: <em>nothing</em> to hook up the ground to in that area. The only option I figured out  was to use one of the rivnuts that are
attached to the tabs welded to the frame, hoping that there's no corrosion there between the aluminum rivnut and steel fuselage. I figured I'd
use a way too long a screw thru one of the rivnuts when attaching that inspection cover, and then pull the ring terminal onto it, and secure it
against the back side of the rivnut with a nut and a washer. Ugly? Yes; but I didn't have any more options. Really, the right way to do that
would be to run two wires from the pilot panel all the way back, but.. I'd have to start cutting fabric for that.</p>
<p>So, I attached the positive to the wire that was already there, terminated my ground, hooked everything up, hooked up some power, and...</p>
<p>Nothing.</p>
<p>A bit of debugging showed that... ground was the problem. Damn! I picked the wrong rivnut, I guess - it had corrosion.
The one right on the other side though showed the right voltage when measured against the positive lead, so I just moved everything to the
other side, and...</p>

<p>First, conduit, cockpit side. Lots of crossing things, lots of padding for bowdens where they cross the wires (I used the right
sized vinyl tubing from my local friendly Aerospace Depot, and lacing to tie it).</p>
<p>Engine monitor harness got covered in tube for quite a distance - there was no way to keep it off and not rubbing on the conduit.</p>

money on shipping small-headed #10 screws (the screws in the terminals are #8 but with small &quot;oval&quot; rather than &quot;pan&quot; aviation style head,
so I'd have to get me some decent screws from McMaster.. by the time I'd be done, it'd be close to those $35).</p>

<hr class="dashed"/><p>This was a small project to wrap up everything I could do firewall forward before moving on to the panel and main wiring.</p>
<p>I wanted to clean up the engine monitor probes harness. When Glenn installed it, he used zipties everywhere (and actually
everything on the plane was ziptied). Nothing wrong with that, except where zipties were used around motor mount and the like
without any cushioning.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2020-05-01-probes/p-1.jpg" title="Probe wires with zipties" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2020-05-01-probes/p-1-thumb.jpg" title="Probe wires with zipties" alt="Probe wires with zipties" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Probe wires with zipties</p><p>But last I checked, zipties weren't used in the 1930s. No, in the 1930s grass was greener, trees taller, water wetter,
and Real Men used wire lacing to tie their wiring harnesses together.</p>
<p>And using adel clamps on round tube is just good karma.</p>
<p>So, I re-did one side first.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2020-05-01-probes/p-2.jpg" title="Properly laced and mounted" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2020-05-01-probes/p-2-thumb.jpg" title="Properly laced and mounted" alt="Properly laced and mounted" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Properly laced and mounted</p><p>Much better isn't it? Those wing nuts are temporary - I will replace them all with real ones when finishing up FWF much later.</p>
<p>I did the other side, though didn't tie it up yet - there will be more wires joining that branch later, and I had to wait until
they were done. But, I did set up all the adel clamps - about 4 pairs of them total.</p>
<p>Next, came the carb temp probe. I had to extend it's wire, and hook it back into the main harness. I repositioned it a long time
ago because I ditched the Rotec TBI, and the old wire was just a touch too short.</p>
<p>I spent quite a bit of time making sure that it's a thermocouple, and that I can reliably extend it - with same material and type
thermocouple wire. I did some basic tests with extending it and making sure it shows reasonable numbers. It did.</p>
<p>I thought a couple times about ditching it; but decided to keep it if I could, and my tests showed that I could do that.</p>
<p>Mounting and routing ended up looking something like this:</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2020-05-01-probes/p-3.jpg" title="Carb temp probe wire" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2020-05-01-probes/p-3-thumb.jpg" title="Carb temp probe wire" alt="Carb temp probe wire" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Carb temp probe wire</p><p>From there, it'd go straight to the motor mount (towards the firewall), and join the engine monitor harness.</p>
<p>When extending the thermocouple, the easiest thing to do is make sure that the joining thermocouple wires mesh together - this
way, you're not introducing a section of a dissimilar metal between two segments.</p>
<p>To do that, I used simple Molex &quot;barrel&quot; butt splices that allow you to put one wire on top of another and crimp around. You
then heatshrink the joint. In fact, I'm starting to like them, and am thinking about using them instead of the usual AMP butt
splices with nylon insulation. They are much cleaner and compact, and heatshrink I use here (SCL) provides ample
strain relief (it shrinks to hard plastic, and glues itself to the wire).</p>

   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2020-05-01-probes/p-6-thumb.jpg" title="Extension being put on" alt="Extension being put on" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Extension being put on</p><p>I shrunk each crimp individually, and then another chunk around the whole thing. The whole thing was set up to be held by a
second clamp (you'll see it in the picture a bit further down).</p>
<p>Back when I <a class="reference external" href="http://79ft.net/entries/cgr-30/">installed the CGR-30</a> on the Cheetah, I encapsulated all the
probe wires into fiberglass sleeve, and here it'd fit perfect - to support the lonely wire spanning about a foot to the motor mount.</p>

<p>Spruce sells these steel &quot;nutserts&quot;, which seemed to fit the bill. Got a set, with install tooling.</p>

<h2>Fat Wires</h2>
<p>The contactors got mounted and torque sealed (of course I forgot to add a diode jumper to the starter contactor, will have
to add later). Next, came figuring out the alternator wire and battery contactor -&gt; shunt jumper (main buss feeder from the battery
basically).</p>
<p>Initially, I thought I could route the alternator wire on the right side of the motor; keeping the starter on the left (remember,
the firewall layout on this plane is reversed of sorts - with battery and oil cooler having their locations swapped and producing
all sorts of grief due to that).</p>
<p>While not bad, holding the alternator wire on the firewall would've required more holes, and it'd go straight down, at
90 degrees to the main harness on the firewall (going left to right), kinda &quot;crossing&quot; it under. So I gave that idea up pretty quick,
instead deciding to run it along that main harness - neatness and 1 less hole/clamp instead of a shorter by about a foot run.</p>

<p>Mr. Max made a comment that it's the music that's distracting me (he was busy building his &quot;water system&quot; out
of the old fuel system hoses and fittings <a class="reference external" href="http://79ft.net/entries/2020-04-29-hosed/">I took out</a> at the time).</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">The initial setup</p><p>I did not like this. See how tight that Master &lt;-&gt; Starter contactor jumper is? It was very tight. The rigid alternator wire
hooked into the ring on the master contactor side was too tight too (that adel clamp that I needed to hold stuff under the
starter contactor had to be there - there will be other wires bundled there later). It was so tight that it bent the ring
when I attempted to set it up.</p>
<p>No, that wasn't good at all.... hmmm..</p>
<p>Aha! I did a similar trick with the gascolator! <a class="reference external" href="http://79ft.net/entries/2020-04-29-hosed/">Reverse the flow</a>.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Flow reversed starter contactor</p><p>Much better! All I did was swapped the jumper from the Master contactor, and the starter lead on the starter contactor; and, while
that made the fat red wire jumper much longer, it made the whole setup much, much cleaner. It made the buss feed wire a bit less pretty,
arguably, with that weird &quot;dip&quot;, but there's no avoiding it. I'll live with that.</p>

torch, and add &quot;solder caps&quot;.</p>

<h2>Ground Strap</h2>
<p>This plane didn't have any. The battery was grounded to the motor (good - the biggest current demand is from the starter). The motor
wasn't grounded to anything else at all, making the current flow thru probably the control cables and fuel hoses to the rest of
the plane. Not good.</p>
<p>So, one was needed. That took more thinking and fiddling. I had a plan initially to ground the battery to the motor and the
motor mount (Grummans do something similar - battery to firewall; and motor mount to motor) - but I wasn't sure about
how good a connection there is between the motor mount and the firewall. So I decided to jump the motor to the firewall -
a very common setup.</p>

<h2>Battery Box</h2>
<p>Battery leads were easy to make. Had to fiddle a bit with grommets (holes in the box are much larger than wires, and I had to
use a &quot;hose section around a wire in the grommet&quot; trick to keep the wire tight and nice.</p>
<p>The battery box was another matter though.</p>
<p>Glenn had replaced the original large (&quot;standard&quot;) battery with a small Odyssey - and took out the space with a bunch of chunks
of random foam...</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Foam</p><p>The box had &quot;dimples&quot; for the battery to stand on, lifted off the bottom (the bottom was made into a funnel of sorts that ended in a
drain - setup for an old school battery that could leak acid). Those dimples were sized for a full size battery, so Odyssey couldn't stand on them.</p>
<p>So, .. ahem.. the solution was?</p>

<p>I hooked up the leads, routed them out of the box, and closed it up, only to realize that the battery was loose in the &quot;up and down&quot;

battery to hit the top and be bouncing if the airplane all of a sudden went to &lt;0G (in turbulence, trivially possible - and
it <em>is</em> aerobatic after all!)</p>
<p>Ordered some foam from McMaster, and padded the top of the box, and the battery sides.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Box top padded</p><p>Now, the battery was sitting solid. No more bouncing.</p>
<p>And with that, I moved on. The main layout was done - the rest of tightening, tying, and strapping has to be done when all the
wires are in, close to the end of this rebuild.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Ugly hose.</p><p>There are a few options of course. Pre-fabbed hoses - you gotta measure carefully and they'll be made to the exact sizes you want.
You can buy fittings and make your own. You can go with different styles - integrated silicone firesleeve or &quot;crimp on&quot;, rubber
or teflon, yada yada.</p>
<p>I decided to go with pre-fabbed. I did the math a number of times; and a pre-fabbed hose was cheaper than making my own.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://www.tsflightlines.com/home.html">TS Flightlines</a> has a great reputation on the Biplane Forum, and are pretty much
the go to guys.</p>
<p>So, time to measure!</p>
<p>I had to re-clock the fittings on the engine fuel pump, so I loosened the jam nuts...</p>
<p>What? .... Jam nuts backed off, and fittings won't turn easily?! They should just unscrew!</p>
<p>Fittings moved with a wrench - and I discovered .. my favorite, The White Schmoo of Death. The teflon dope.</p>
<p>For some inexplicable reason, whomever undid the plumbing last time, re-plumbed it with the sealant everywhere. Okay, NPT fittings
need sealant (though, a choice of a crumbly drying type stuff is questionable - because when it's left in a female fitting, getting
it out without it getting it's crumbs into the system is almost impossible). But o-ring boss? Where there's a straight thread fitting
with a nut and an o-ring? No sir! The o-ring seals it just fine! Siiigh.</p>
<p>Here it is. That lovely sealant.</p>

it out of the TBI. Frankly, I was glad I tossed the TBI altogether, hoping that that was the only place I'd
find that sealant... Only to.. Oh well.</p>
<p>I had to take the pump out. No way I could clean out that damn stuff out of the hole w/o getting it all inside.</p>
<p>Slowly and steadily, with the hole pointed down, I scraped and scraped and scraped it with my dental pick, followed with a brush wetted
in Goof Off that kinda softens it. It was.. hours. For two holes.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Clean.</p><p>Phew. The pump went back on, and finally, I could clock the fittings how I wanted them.</p>
<p>I used a few old hoses I had lying around, and chunks of safety wire to mock up my new ones; measured the mockups, and
made a bunch of pictures like this:</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">A drawing of a hose</p><p>Next morning, I called TS.</p>
<p>Tom, the owner, is the guy who answers the phone. A quick email with pictures, a quick conversation about various hose ends
(we ended up doing a few -3's instead of -2's as I had before), etc etc - and the order was in.</p>
<p>And, a few days later, a box showed up at my door!</p>
<p>Next time at the hangar, I tried them on. The hoses were perfect! But, something I haven't considered before...</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2020-04-29-hosed/h-21.jpg" title="Tee to engine pump" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2020-04-29-hosed/h-21-thumb.jpg" title="Tee to engine pump" alt="Tee to engine pump" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Tee to engine pump</p><p>There's a tee. Right side is connected to the gascolator. Left side - to the electrical pump. Both horizontal sides
of the tee are connected with aluminum tubing. Notice the adel on the right holding onto the flare nut. The adel on the left,
barely visible, is holding onto the <em>tube</em> - motor mount geometry isn't allowing it to grab onto the nut.</p>
<p>And the whole thing is aluminum, and the hose is creating a ton of leverage onto that tee.</p>
<p>It's not the problem with my hose. I should've realized this before I even ventured there. The old hose had the same problem, of course.</p>
<p>Aluminum has fatigue life. The motor shakes. The whole thing shakes, connected by the hose. How that tee didn't crack is...
anyone's guess. On top of that, how the tube didn't crack is even more miraculous.</p>
<p>I showed it to Deene Ogden - one of our Chapter's very experienced guys. He agreed with my hunch. His suggested fix was to attempt
to tie that hose end somehow into the firewall, so that it doesn't create that much leverage.</p>
<p>Well, easier said than done. Firewall on this thing is .035 - and not rigid at all.</p>
<p>I showed it to Tom (the TS Flightlines guy). He thought that even the fact that there's aluminum tubing between firewall
and engine mount is a bad thing - though there the relative motion is small, it still might crack a tube or a flare.</p>
<p>Top that with my general dislike towards the non-firesleeved sections of aluminum tubing firewall forward (I admit, I actually
attempted to figure out a nice way to sleeve them), and incorrectly plumbed fuel transducer (it was on the &quot;suction&quot; side -
before all the pumps - and it <em>is</em> a restriction - and a restriction on a sucking side is a potential for vapor lock) - and I,
in my usual manner, decided to, of course, rebuild the whole thing.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="disassembly">
<h2>Disassembly</h2>
<p>Well, that was easy - except for my favorite white crap everywhere. All the fittings were aluminum, and most of the fittings
weren't AN.</p>
<p>Now, similar to a conversation of which sealant to use on NPT threads (you can start a fight amongst best friends by bringing it up!),
there's a massive holy war on aluminum vs. steel FWF. I am in the steel camp.</p>
<p>And there's another, smaller holy war, about using &quot;racing&quot; fittings. Folks that do say &quot;if it's good for NASCAR, it's good
enough for us&quot;. I don't know. I don't buy that. First of, those fittings are of extremely varying quality (AN level all the way
down to cheap Chinesium). Second, race cars are rebuilt all the time - and in an airplane, I bet some of those are 40 years old. Or 20.
You get the idea.</p>
<p>So I am firmly in the &quot;AN, steel&quot; camp. Even though they are $20 a pop.</p>
<p>Transducer was the hardest to clean out, because I needed to make sure none of that white crud went into it. My friend and hangar neighbor Dick G. suggested running a tap with flutes filled with grease to pick up the crud... hmm... I didn't have the right size
tap, and that sounded a bit too extreme.. but the idea..</p>

<div class="section" id="the-plan-and-the-mockups">
<h2>The Plan, and the Mockups</h2>
<p>So since we're redoing the whole thing; first thing I was gonna do is dump the parallel plumbing of the pumps. I guess,
Remo's idea was that in case the electric pump fails in a mode where it blocks the flow of fuel thru it, the gas
will still be able to go thru the &quot;alternative&quot; branch and still reach the mechanical pump.</p>
<p>Not sure about that. I am very used to Grummans, which are plumbed in series (electrical -&gt; engine pump -&gt; carb),
and I have not heard of a single failure there. I have heard of this type failure on an RV, which used a solid state
Facet pump that Facet tells you not to use on airplanes.</p>
<p>Okay, actually, this whole Facet pump situation is interesting, apparently. Bendix used to make these electrical pumps, but
then Facet bought that part of their business. Nowadays, they explicitly tell you not to use their pumps on airplanes!</p>
<p>But, Dave Fletcher of <a class="reference external" href="http://fletchair.com">Fletchair</a> fame buys batches of particular Facet models, and runs tests on them. He
sells off the ones that don't pass (apparently, flow rates vary wildly), and tags the ones that pass. He then sells them to Grumman
folk.</p>
<p>Hey, good enough for Grumman - good enough for me! I can have my much simpler series system (less hoses, less connections, less
fittings, less space), and trust the pump. And they're cheap! (Well, relatively speaking).</p>
<p>So, I got a pump from Fletch and bolted it on.</p>
<p>Transducer was the next big ticket item. It had to go between the engine driven pump, and the carb - the &quot;last step&quot; in the chain.</p>
<p>I needed something to mock things up. I needed hose ends.</p>
<p>... now, what's with those racing hose ends?</p>
<p>I called Mario - a great guy who fixes my cars when I don't want to :). His thing is drag racing.</p>
<p>He knew a place.</p>
<p>Couple hours later, and with a lighter wallet, I had a bag of fittings that were close enough in size, and a chunk of hose to cut up.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">One of the first x-cer mockups</p><p>This was the first. Followed what Fletcher did on the Cheetah back when we
<a class="reference external" href="http://79ft.net/entries/cgr-30/">installed the CGR-30</a>, but on the Cheetah the hose went back towards the firewall
and did a nice 180 u-turn, and came back to the carb. Here, I had to go &quot;sideways&quot; to do this &quot;hanging&quot; style if I wanted it. It
produced a weird low spot in the loop that I didn't like.</p>
<p>Next!</p>
<p>Could I maybe still have the x-cer on the firewall, and reuse some of the holes?</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2020-04-29-hosed/h-40.jpg" title="Second mockup" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2020-04-29-hosed/h-40-thumb.jpg" title="Second mockup" alt="Second mockup" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Second mockup</p><p>Much better I thought. I ran those by Tom of TS Flightlines. He thought the second setup was better, and recommended using
one of his fancy &quot;u-turn&quot;
fittings to save on the hose length. He gave me dimensions. I realized that I suck at mocking things up, and asked him if he
would be able to send me the fitting (I would gladly pay for it). He said, of course. He could send me whatever fittings I wanted,
and just figure the cost in the end. I'd make mockups and send them to him. Heck, he'd send me the hose too - and I'd cut it to size,
and make the hoses - then send them back to him, and he'll crimp and firesleeve them.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>And he was a treasure trove of information. Basically, hand-held me all the way. And I took it, and am very grateful. This was my
first plumbing job - so I needed the help.</p>
<p>One big fear I had was running bent fittings before and after the transducer, because they can induce turbulence in the flow.
Tom said that they ran them in whichever configuration, and they work fine with the setup he was suggesting. That was a great relief
too.</p>
<p>So, I made my &quot;shopping&quot; list, and he put the fittings in the mail.</p>
<p>I got them, and ran over to the nearby auto parts place to get some hose for the mockup (I decided not to fiddle with cutting
braided teflon hose). The guy took me back, we found the right I.D. stuff. I asked for ten feet. &quot;This is fuel hose, it's expensive&quot;,
said the guy. I asked how much. &quot;Two-something a foot&quot;, was the response.</p>
<p>I almost cracked up. I then told him that the fitting I brought in to check, that one fitting, was probably twice as much as 10 feet
of that hose. We then had a very nice conversation about everything airplanes :).</p>
<p>My final mockup, with fittings from Tom, looked like this:</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">The Final Mockup</p><p>The gascolator hookup looks funny, doesn't it? It's &quot;reversed&quot; - because otherwise, I had no room for hoses at all.</p>
<p>And then, the mock hoses were sent back to Tom for final fabrication.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-gascolator">
<h2>The Gascolator</h2>
<p>Somewhere in between all the mocking up and messing around, I had to figure out what to do with the gascolator. See, it had no
mount. None.</p>
<p>It was basically &quot;hanging&quot; on the fittings coming into each side, and rigid aluminum tubing. Yeah. Ugh. But that's besides the
point - with flexible hoses, it'll be bouncing in that &quot;ring holder&quot; that isn't holding it at all, apparently.</p>
<p>I'll admit, buying a new gascolator with mounting options crossed my mind. But then.. I thought, maybe some kind of latch..</p>
<p>Something that will hook to the bottom of the ring on the gascolator, and the top of that &quot;bracket&quot; and pull it up.</p>
<p>I search McMaster and other catalogues and couldn't find anything... An idea crossed my mind.. maybe..</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Installed!</p><p>It worked! I made two more - planning to have them at 120 degrees to each other around the gascolator.</p>
<p>The diameter of the gascolator's top was a smidge undersized for the ring it was in - Glenn had some kind of a sticky foam
in there. I replaced it with proper, aircraft grade felt :).</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Felt pad</p><p>And then, the drain.</p>
<p>The quickdrain on that bowl was leaking. I found that a looong time ago, and attempted to replace it. Obviously, I had to take
the old one out....</p>
<p>... only to discover that the threads on the bowl were all chewed up.</p>
<p>No problem, thought I, and ordered a new bowl from Spruce.</p>
<p>The threads on that one.. looked even worse.</p>
<p>I contacted Spruce. No problem! They sent me a new one.....</p>
<p>... slightly better, but still chewed up!</p>
<p>Here's one of the pictures I sent to Spruce back then, just for illustration.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2020-04-29-hosed/gask.jpg" title="Bad threads" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2020-04-29-hosed/gask-thumb.jpg" title="Bad threads" alt="Bad threads" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Bad threads</p><p>They said, they will talk to the manufacturer, and have them direct ship one to me. Then, they got silent for a long time, and
then I somehow ended up with two? I think? All with bad threads.</p>
<p>All and all, I ended up with <em>five</em> bowls. That happened almost a year ago, and frankly, I don't exactly remember how exactly the
fifth happend, but I ended up with five.
And Spruce didn't want them back. And they refunded me the money.</p>
<p>But that was then. This was now. Now, I had a tap just the right size, and was set up in the hangar.</p>
<p>This is a 1/8&quot; NPT thread - so tapping it just a hair further would re-cut the bad parts and remove a bit more material, fixing
the threads.</p>
<p>So I took one of the bowls, re-tapped the hole, and started putting in the quickdrain. Ha! Not so easy. There's nothing on the bowl to
grab onto, and I had to tighten the quick drain pretty tight (1 1/2 to 2 turns past hand tight).</p>
<p>I kinda tried to use my vise to help me - holding onto the round thing isn't easy but I tried, using my hand too... Clack! The wrench
slipped, and the bowl went bouncing on the floor.</p>
<p>A bit of damage surveillance showed a nick on the lip where it contacts the rubber seal on the gascolator top, and my better part decided
that I need to be punished and re-do it. Heck, I had FIVE bowls!</p>
<p>So, I tapped the second one. The quick drain went in. It was annoying, but I managed. 1 1/2 turns.</p>
<p>Hmm.. Why does it look so weird... and not work?
Hmm.... Did the torque and compressing the hollow quickdrain with &quot;wedge&quot; action of NPT thread mess it up? Evidently.</p>
<p>But I turned it 1 1/2 turns!!</p>
<p>Idiot me, of course. The 1 1/2 turns is probably too much to begin with (though Vans recommends it in their manual). And besides, they
talk about AN plumbing fittings. Not special fittings like this quick drain.</p>
<p>I googled &quot;Curtiss Quick Drain Torque&quot;... Sure enough. Tiny. 40 inch pounds if I remember correctly. Way to be an idiot, dude.</p>
<p>But I have three more bowls to mess up!</p>
<p>Okay, bowl number three.... tap... attempt to hold... slip.. fall... DING! Damn.</p>
<p>This is stupid, I know. I had to stop and figure out a fixture to hold the bowl while torquing the fitting after the first one
slipped out of the vice (try holding a round object in a vice w/o a fixture?! Idiot). This was the ... &quot;try to get away with it&quot; mode.</p>
<p>Enough. See, I was in such a weird state of mind I didn't take any pictures?</p>
<p>And the solution was simple and right there, of course.</p>

<p>I messed with the transducer a ton. That was another hard part to hold - and I'll admit to bending it's outside box
(that's non-sequitir but annoying). This transducer is weird - it has it's body and it's brains all in a very thin sheet stainless
&quot;box&quot;, making it virtually impossible to hold onto and screw the fitting in. But the bend in that body doesn't affect anything - it's
like a &quot;cover&quot;.</p>
<p>I'll admit to thinking I overtorqued the transducer fittings, too - and removing them to check for cracks (only to find that no,
I actually didn't overtorque them - the manufacturer's spec was higher).</p>
<p>But in the end, it all worked out for the initial hookup. I'll have to tighten everything and clean up the angles on the fittings
a bit when getting closer to the engine start; but the initial fit up worked great. Tom did a great job!</p>

<hr class="dashed"/><p>Pressure transducers. Those little doodads that take liquid pressure and transform it into electrical pixies on the
wire...</p>
<p>The ones I got are from <a class="reference external" href="http://umainstruments.com/">UMA</a>. I'm replacing the mechanical engine gauge with
electric - same 3-in-1 (oil temp, pressure, fuel pressure); but the fluids stay under the cowling. Pixies run
in the wires to the gauge and rat those fluids out to it.</p>
<p>Ahem.</p>
<p>Well, this was always a part of the plan:</p>

   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2020-02-23-xcers-brackets/b-1-thumb.jpg" title="Pressure transducer on adels" alt="Pressure transducer on adels" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Pressure transducer on adels</p><p>but this never felt like sufficient. Only rubber (will harden up pronto) and screw torque (well, not too shabby,
but still) prevent it from rotating. Plus, a single point of failure - and I am probably over too sensitive to
a probability of dangling fluid hoses with transducers at the end under the cowling in flight.</p>
<p>No sir, we can do better!</p>
<p>Long time ago, I have <a class="reference external" href="http://79ft.net/entries/cgr-30/">installed a CGR-30 onto my Cheetah</a>,
and back then I mounted the transducers on two adels - but those were different style transducers, much longer
than the ones UMA makes.</p>
<p>But they have that threaded &quot;neck&quot; and a nut on it.. hmm... Let's see if we can make some
kind of a bracket?</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2020-02-23-xcers-brackets/b-2.jpg" title="Marking the hole" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2020-02-23-xcers-brackets/b-2-thumb.jpg" title="Marking the hole" alt="Marking the hole" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Marking the hole</p><p>Start with our good old friend aluminum angle. Now, the &quot;tab&quot; on the bracket will screw with another
adel on the motor mount; that was the idea (so the bracket basically was replacing a second adel around
the transducer that didn't fit). Therefore, the tab off of my bracket would have to be co-planar with the
adel. It did not have to be super precise - I figured, 1/32&quot; of mistake was fine.</p>
<p>A bit of black sharpie transferred the imprint quite nicely.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">The bracket taking shape</p><p>And then, bandsaw and sander. Had to break out my good files to clean up the &quot;fillet&quot; that
remained after cutting off one side of the angle under the nut (otherwise, the nut won't fit).</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Pferd and Grobet, the two buddies at work</p><p>OKay, now, let's add a bit more fanciness to it. Using the nut to draw out circumference and to make sure to
stay well clear for now</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Now, make it "flow"</p><p>This above picture also shows the filed area real well - bottom left.</p>
<p>Finally, need to drill the hole for the adjoining adel in the horizontal portion - that one needs to be somewhat
precise too, if the transducer is to sit straight. So, we'll test mount it on one adel, and mark out
the second hole using the second adel.</p>

<p>Tadaa!</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Jack likes the bracket very much.</p><p>But we have another transducer. That one's bracket will have to be &quot;mirror image&quot; of the first one.</p>
<p>I used the first bracket to kinda &quot;estimate&quot; the second.</p>

<hr class="dashed"/><p><a class="reference external" href="http://79ft.net/entries/2019-09-01-carb-cables/">Quite a while back</a> I have measured the control cables and ordered them.</p>
<p>They took a long time to show up, and then I was working on this amongst other things. Just finished now :).</p>
<p>So, right to it, shall we?</p>
<p>First things first was to get thru the firewall. I had these fancy penetration trims for cables called 'CableSafe' from Spruce</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2020-02-21-carb-finished/cable-safe.jpg" title="Cable Safe" >

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Throttle cable with it</p><p>Hmm... problem one. Washers clearly won't fit given the old holes in the firewall (Remo had grommets there, but I wanted
something a bit more substantial).</p>
<p>No worries - we'll make me a special washer!</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Cabin side of the firewall</p><p>And then, came fiddling. Most of it was done before ordering the cables, but I still wanted to check and re-check everything.</p>
<p>Hooked the clevis ends to the control cables, and the cables to the carb to verify everything.</p>
<p>When measuring, I figured I'd need a rod end for the mixture arm due to misalignment of the cable rod and the control arm. And
the damn bushing, too - because the hole in the carb is 1/4&quot;, and the bolt is #10. I got some bushing stock from McMaster, but
it was too long - had to shorten it with some creative sanding.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Airbox - do you see it?</p><p>See how it's tilted to the right (clockwise)?</p>
<p>I spent quite a bit of time there trying to figure out what's wrong. I put the cowling back on!!</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2020-02-21-carb-finished/c-10.jpg" title="With cowling" >

 </a> <p class="small text-center">With cowling</p><p>Still crooked.</p>
<p>I kept thinking and thinking. It's motor -&gt; oil sump -&gt; carb -&gt; airbox -&gt; filter. That's how everything's bolted together. The first three are not &quot;home buit&quot;, so I didn't think they were off. So it must've been the airbox and / or the filter mount.</p>
<p>Upon closer examination, I realized that the airbox was welded together way off, and is crooked itself. And the filter is mounted
even more crooked in the same clockwise direction.</p>
<p>To confirm, searched all the pics I could find online of the plane prior to my having it (and disassembling the front).</p>
<p>It was hard to tell, but.. I think it was like this from the very beginning.</p>
<p>Phew.</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>Meanwhile, we had a night of a kind of weather when it rains without actually raining - you know, as if you are in a cloud with
large droplets. Everything in the hangar got soaked, obviously. Including my clevis ends.</p>

   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2020-02-21-carb-finished/c-11-thumb.jpg" title="Rust on a new rod end?!" alt="Rust on a new rod end?!" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Rust on a new rod end?!</p><p>Aren't they supposed to be cad plated? Oh; and that was the first time I really noticed how cad plating sacrifices itself to prevent
rust on steel - a lot of my hardware was covered in little white stains, which were cadmium having corroded and saved steel.</p>
<p>At any rate, I double checked the order paperwork. &quot;Cad plated&quot;. Hmmmm. They definitely were <em>not</em>.</p>
<p>Called Spruce. She checked and doublechecked - and confirmed that indeed, their vendor stopped doing cad plated clevis forks specifically in that dimension - #10 end, #10 rod. They refunded my money, and let me keep the forks.</p>
<p>Called SkyGeek, asking about the clevis forks they sell. The lady goes, &quot;yep, plated&quot;. I ask her to triple-confirm.</p>
<p>She takes about 10 minutes, and gets back to me - nope, not plated. She's sorry. No longer made.</p>
<p>John F., a local IA, confirmed. Only plain steel now, seems that cad plated forks are unobtanium. Crap! Oh well, I guess, paying
attention and making sure to put oil or something similar on them from time to time is in my future.</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>Glenn had a carb temp probe in the Rotec TBI I am replacing, and I decided to try to keep it. Wire was cut way too short for how
everything's on the carb (vs. the TBI), so I spent a bit of time pondering if:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The probe was a thermistor, or a thermocouple</li>
<li>If latter, could I successfully extend it</li>
</ul>
<p>Pouring thru (mostly AeroLectric Bob Nuckoll's) notes on thermocouples, realized that some are magnetic. Let's see.. score!
Magnetic indeed.</p>
<p>Got some multi-strand thermocouple wire of the same kind (red/yellow - I forget which metals those are :) ), and did some &quot;back-bench&quot;
testing.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Hook up the probe direct to the gauge</li>
<li>Pour solvent onto the probe tip, watch for rate of temp change and lowest point</li>
<li>Extend the wire now, do the pour again</li>
<li>Subjectively decide if the indications were &quot;roughly matching&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>They seemed to have been indeed matching, so I decided to attempt to keep the probe.</p>
<p>But, problem. It'd interfere with the airbox'es mounting bracket (and for some reason, I didn't take a picture of that :( ).</p>
<p>So first, let's cut a slot that will let that bracket clear the wire.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2020-02-21-carb-finished/c-13.jpg" title="Slot" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2020-02-21-carb-finished/c-13-thumb.jpg" title="Slot" alt="Slot" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Slot</p><p>A bit of drilling, a bit of hacksawing, and a bit of filing.</p>
<p>Then,</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2020-02-21-carb-finished/c-15.jpg" title="Trial fit" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2020-02-21-carb-finished/c-15-thumb.jpg" title="Trial fit" alt="Trial fit" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Trial fit</p><p>Nope, still not good. The carb temp probe there is the little thing that looks like a bolt with a wire sticking out of it -
and it's hex was interfering a bit. But we cleared the wire now.</p>
<p>So, a touch more cutting was in order.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2020-02-21-carb-finished/c-18.jpg" title="A touch more cutting" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2020-02-21-carb-finished/c-18-thumb.jpg" title="A touch more cutting" alt="A touch more cutting" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">A touch more cutting</p><p>... and it fit.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Since I was messing with the airbox, needed to finish one last thing on it.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2020-02-21-carb-finished/c-19.jpg" title="Carb heat bowden bracket" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2020-02-21-carb-finished/c-19-thumb.jpg" title="Carb heat bowden bracket" alt="Carb heat bowden bracket" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Carb heat bowden bracket</p><p>That bracket holds the carb heat bowden cable. Notice something weird? Yep, castellated <em>shear nuts</em> and <em>pins</em>. And, no, they weren't
tight either, so the whole bracket business was wobbling around.</p>
<p>I spent quite some time pondering why would it be set up like that. Castellated, pin, not tight, wobble - all of that adds up to
&quot;he wanted that bracket to move around&quot;. It adds up really well too! The setup makes total sense if he wanted to have this
arm move around - but there is absolutely no reason for it to do that! In fact, it's not good at all - steel bracket with steel bolts
moving around holes drilled thru aluminum airbox - that would elongate and tear up those holes!</p>
<p>I decided that no. It should not move around, in fact. So,</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Hardware replaced</p><p>--</p>
<p>And then, the final hookups of everything after a long break. Routed the cables, and hooked them up with adel clamps where necessary
(doing that conforms them to their final shape, which causes some changes in positions of the cable and controls and the range of
motion).</p>
<p>Then, fine-tuned positioning of the controls, and tightened the pivot bolt on the bellcranks. Clevis pins might still need to come out
- and that's why cotter pins aren't bent yet - just in case I'll need to unhook them again.</p>

<p>Ha!</p>
<p>Nowhere near.</p>
<p>You see, one of the things I wanted to fix prior to putting the plane back in the air was this.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Wing root fairing</p><p>You're looking at the bottom right wing root fairing, all oily and burnt up, with paint flaking.
It is bad. Really bad.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because it is bathed in the exhaust, and because Glenn added the smoke system on top of that.</p>
<p>Here's the best couple  pictures I have to illustrate what's going on.</p>

You can see how in the slipstream this will hit the wing root and the side, which is very much evidenced by the stains,
oil streaks, and, well, burnt up paint on the fairing.</p>
<p>I wanted to fix this very, very, very much.</p>
<div class="section" id="research">
<h2>Research</h2>
<p>As much as I am absolutely <em>not</em> afraid of electrical systems, I am very afraid of exhaust systems (and a few other things).
I just don't know enough or have enough experience.</p>
<p>What turned up to be even worse was trying to find someone who <em>does</em> know what they're talking about. I poked around, and couldn't find
anyone around or in our Chapter that knows this stuff well to be able to tell me &quot;do this, and I got a TIG machine in the corner
to weld up whatever you need&quot;.</p>
<p>So, I did the second best thing I could.</p>
<p>A couple years back, I met a gentleman at Oshkosh at our Biplane Forum gathering, Mr. T., who wrote a series of articles on motors,
including exhaust.</p>
<p>He agreed graciously to listen to me (well, &quot;read&quot;, technically) rant, and maybe guide me a bit.</p>
<p>So, to the drawing board!</p>
<p>I had to put the system back on, and hang the cowling back on the airplane as well, so that I could check everything in place.</p>
<p>When I took the exhaust system off, I plugged the stubs coming off of cylinders with duct tape. Big mistake!</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2020-02-17-exhaust/e-4.jpg" title="Duct tape on the stubs" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2020-02-17-exhaust/e-4-thumb.jpg" title="Duct tape on the stubs" alt="Duct tape on the stubs" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Duct tape on the stubs</p><p>Cleaning that crap off took GoofOff and about an hour.</p>

   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2020-02-17-exhaust/e-6-thumb.jpg" title="Old tailpipe" alt="Old tailpipe" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Old tailpipe</p><p>That's the head on picture of the old stub.</p>
<p>The first and the easiest possibility was, what would happen if I just extended it straight out?</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2020-02-17-exhaust/e-8.jpg" title="Straight extension - head on" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2020-02-17-exhaust/e-8-thumb.jpg" title="Straight extension - head on" alt="Straight extension - head on" >

   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2020-02-17-exhaust/e-7-thumb.jpg" title="Straight extension - side view" alt="Straight extension - side view" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Straight extension - side view</p><p>I used a piece of paper to mock that up. Mind you, that'd be about a 10&quot; extension! Lots of pipe, considering that the original tailpipe
was maybe 16 inches long total.</p>
<p>It was obvious that doing this would move the exhaust outboard way more than moving it down. Why is this bad? Well, the bulk of it was
hitting the aluminum side of the fuse and the plastic (okay, okay, fiberglass :) ) root fairing. Moved out this way, it would be
hitting the fabric-covered leading edge. Somehow, that didn't sit well with me, and Mr. T. concurred.</p>
<p>So, I went on a scavenging run, and borrowed a nice piece of exhaust grade 3&quot; SCAT from Mr. Dick G., my friendly neighbor, and attempted
to mock something up with that.</p>
<p>Now <em>that</em> went way better!</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2020-02-17-exhaust/e-9.jpg" title="Approx 45 degrees" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2020-02-17-exhaust/e-9-thumb.jpg" title="Approx 45 degrees" alt="Approx 45 degrees" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Approx 45 degrees</p><p>That moved the exhaust point downward, and I realized that I could play with it even more by bringing it closer to the airbox via
cutting progressively more off of the old tailpipe (at this point with SCAT I haven't yet cut anything, because I was just playing
and wasn't committed).</p>
<p>That seemed like a way to go. So, next step was to mock this up with a real 45 degree bend.</p>
<p>I got the cheapest slip-on 45 degree mandrel bend from Summit.</p>
<p>At this point, I had to commit, because using this slip-on would require some cutting.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2020-02-17-exhaust/e-10.jpg" title="Some cutting" >

 </a> <p class="small text-center">And some more cutting</p><p>And then, the fit with the bottom cowl on.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Side view</p><p>That looked just perfect! A total of about 8 inches of tube added overall, and the exhaust actually moved inboard, and way down into
the slip stream.</p>
<p>All that was left to do was to buy the actual 45 degree bend I'd be using, and find a welder.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="unobtanium">
<h2>Unobtanium</h2>
<p>I was looking around for welder who'd be willing and able while playing with the geometry. Asking around the airport didn't yield much.</p>
<p>Backup plan was Seth from <a class="reference external" href="https://marioshopllc.com/">Marioshop</a> - the guy I take my cars to (his boss is a dragster, and Seth welded a lot of tube and exhaust -
although, automotive, much thicker kind, with MIG).</p>
<p>I contacted folks from another EAA Chapter, the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.eaa59.org/">Waco 59</a>, a great and dynamic EAA Chapter which I am also
a member of, and scored - their very experienced Tech Counselor and metalworker Mike M. agreed to help me with the project. He welded
himself, and also knew a gentleman that was &quot;very artistic with his welds&quot;, as he put it.</p>
<p>I just had to get the material, jig it up to position it, and come over to weld everything up.</p>
<p>My tailpipe was 3 inches in diameter (jumping a bit ahead of myself, unusual for a motor of my size - too big). I measured .049 with
my dial calipers, which translated into 18GA, and ordered the nicest shiny new bend from Summit. When it came, I realized...</p>
<p>It was the wrong thing.</p>
<p>Way thicker than what I had.</p>
<p>I think I mis-measured. Maybe I was asleep when I did it, maybe there was a lot of crud on the old pipe and I didn't pay attention,
maybe .. but I needed 0.035 material. 20 gauge.</p>
<p>Quick Internet search - nothing.</p>
<p>More Internet searching - nothing.</p>
<p>I could buy all kinds of bends in smaller diameter tubing with 0.035 wall thickness. I could buy 3&quot; tubing with 0.049 wall. I could <em>not</em> find
3&quot; 45 degree bend in 0.035.</p>
<p>One company offered to sell me a straight piece. That was a good backup - we could've mitered and welded up the 45 degree bend in
sections, but I wanted to see if I could find a bend. That same company offered to make me one - at a low price of about 600 bucks.
Yikes!</p>
<p>Attempting to Hail Mary again, I <a class="reference external" href="https://www.biplaneforum.com/threads/sources-for-large-diameter-ss-exhaust-tubing-bends.19296/#post-228307">posted on the Biplane Forum</a>. Guys came back with a bunch of phone ##s of their contacts, and I started calling around!</p>
<p>Nope, nope, nope. I don't remember who it was, but one of the guys I called suggested contacting
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.customaircraft.com/">Custom Aircraft Parts</a>.</p>
<p>A nice lady answered. &quot;You gotta talk to Clint&quot;, she said, and transferred me.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="clint">
<h2>Clint</h2>
<p>Clint picked up. I asked if they could sell me the  bend. Clint asked, &quot;What are you trying to do&quot;?</p>
<p>I explained.</p>
<p>He asked for pictures. A bit weirded out, I sent them over.</p>
<p>&quot;I have two things I wanna tell you&quot;, said Clint.</p>
<p>&quot;Buy yourself a bottle of soap and a nice rag&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;Be careful what you wish for&quot;.</p>
<p>Clit knew this 4-into-1 setup with a muffler in between very well. He told me  that even with me trying to keep the extension
as short as possible, I was running a risk of it cracking off at the muffler. Would it for sure? He didn't know. But the risk was
increasing a lot.</p>
<p>I called my old friend and a Grumman aficionado Ben the same night. Grummans have this style mufflers (mine didn't by the way
because it was sporting Powerflow - a very different system).</p>
<p>&quot;Hey, do you recall welding cracked off tailpipes?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;For sure&quot;.</p>
<p>Damn! Damn damn damn.</p>
<p>More mulling over ensued. I did <em>not</em> want to risk a tail pipe cracked off at the muffler. No way. That puts hot exhaust into a very
tight cowling. On a biplane. With my having elevated fear of any in flight fire. Remember, I embarked on the electrical
rebuild because I judged this airplane to be a <a class="reference external" href="http://79ft.net/entries/2019-05-16-fire-hazard/">flying fire hazard</a>.</p>
<p>I talked with Ben more. I talked with Mike from Waco 59 more.</p>
<p>The attempted fix solidified.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2020-02-17-exhaust/e-14.jpg" title="Exhaust hanger" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2020-02-17-exhaust/e-14-thumb.jpg" title="Exhaust hanger" alt="Exhaust hanger" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Exhaust hanger</p><p>I would put a ball joint somewhere close to the muffler, with one end on the old pipe, and one end on the new extension that includes
the bend. That ball would isolate the extension from the existing system, and allow them to move relative to one another.</p>
<p>I would then hang the new extension to the oil sump on some kind of hanger with a clamp - likely, a kind of tube with ends flattened
and bent as required.</p>
<p>I sent this schematic to Clint. Well, no, not this one. This is a nice one I did when writing this post, over a picture I took
when mocking up this solution. The one I sent to Clint was this. But, same idea.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2020-02-17-exhaust/clint.jpg" title="Schematic I sent to Clint" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2020-02-17-exhaust/clint-thumb.jpg" title="Schematic I sent to Clint" alt="Schematic I sent to Clint" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Schematic I sent to Clint</p><p>Clint's response? Verbatim:</p>
<p><em>Adding a ball joint and brace solves all of my concerns, you are free to do anything you want to the tailpipe. If you weld the bend on as your latest drawing shows, looks more reasonable. When adding a support brace it is imperative that it stabilizes the tailpipe to the engine, they must move together.</em></p>
<p>WOOT! Did I find a way to do what I wanted?</p>
<p>One thing to absolutely ensure was that the ball joint would fit.</p>
<p>We went back and forth a bit, me asking about dimensions. Then, I threw together a quick drawing of the widest part of the ball
joint - the clamp holding it together - and tried it next time I was in the hangar.</p>
<p>No way. No way it hell it would fit. Airbox would get in the way.</p>
<p>Here's probably the best picture I have of why.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2020-02-17-exhaust/mike.jpg" title="Clearances" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2020-02-17-exhaust/mike-thumb.jpg" title="Clearances" alt="Clearances" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Clearances</p><p>That little triangle of &quot;air&quot; in between the cowling (bottom), exhaust pipe, and airbox is probably 1 inch on sides. No way a ball
would fit in there. No freaking way.</p>
<p>So, what am I left with?</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="putting-it-back-together-the-way-it-was">
<h2>Putting it Back Together, the Way It Was</h2>
<p>I gave up.</p>
<p>Called Clint on the way back from the airport, and asked him to sell me a straight length of pipe with a slip fit on one end.</p>
<p>Got it a week later.</p>
<p>Called Mike, got a contact for his welder, and went there.</p>
<p>The gentleman didn't like the fit - too loose - and wanted to make sure I pinned it exactly where I wanted (and actually,
I should've done that in the first place, because the opening in the cowling is very tight, and just a degree of being off would
make it interfere with the cowling). He also wanted me to clean all the gunk off.</p>
<p>So, back to the hangar, and fun fun fun with a die grinder, deburring wheel, wire brush... This 40 year old exhaust is gunky!!!</p>

in the exact clocking I needed.</p>
<p>Mike's welder fell thru, and that cost me a couple weeks at least. I focused on some other work - panels, compass, etc.</p>
<p>One of those days, I was on the phone with D. when a gentleman I didn't recognise walked over from the hangar next door housing a PT-19,
and asked to borrow a hex key.  When I hung up, I walked over to introduce myself.</p>
<p>&quot;Hi, I'm M.&quot;</p>
<p>M.?! <strong>The</strong> M.?</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>He's somewhat of a local celebrity, having built a ton of airplanes, and having worked on more. I met him on a couple occasions in
passing, but not really, and I didn't remember his face when he walked over. He's a sheet metal and generally a metal
guy. He was working on the PT-19's electrical (ha, fun coincidence, eh?)</p>
<p>A lot of hangar flying ensued.</p>
<p>He looked over the biplane. He told me of his building a replica <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hughes_H-1_Racer">Hughes H-1</a>.
Of <em>his own design</em> basically.</p>
<p>When parting ways, I asked, &quot;Hey, do you have a welder by any chance?&quot; Asking doesn't hurt right?
&quot;Yep, I got a TIG machine&quot;.</p>
<p>Ha! Of course :) I meant to ask if he <em>knew</em> a welder. But he <em>was</em> one. I should've thought of that myself.</p>
<p>He agreed to help me weld the damn thing back on, of course. He asked for me to clean the insides. It kinda made sense, too - you want
full penetration when welding, and you don't want all that crud on the inside of the tube to &quot;float up&quot;.</p>
<p>So, lots more of a die grinder time, with flapwheels, with a compressor barely large enough to run the damn thing for a minute straight.</p>
<p>Then, drove to M's shop, drooled over the H-1 and the MP-14 that he had on it.</p>
<p>And then, the final fit of the tailpipe to put it where it was when I cut it off.</p>
<p>We put the exhaust back on the plane,..</p>

<hr class="dashed"/><p>A couple things have been always on the back burner - fuse blocks, and finishing up the oil cooler bowden hookup.</p>
<p>In between waiting for completion of The Thing I Am Yet To Write About, finally, checked those off the list.</p>
<div class="section" id="fuse-blocks">
<h2>Fuse Blocks</h2>
<p>Location was figured out <a class="reference external" href="http://79ft.net/entries/2019-09-08-fwf-side-channel-panel-layouts/">a long time ago</a>, and I just
clamped them in place, center punched the holes, and drilled them.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Clamped in place for hole marking</p><p>One little bit was to figure out the exact fastener lengths and washer stacks, because the right one had it's right (forward most) end riding
on top of a reasonably thick aluminum placard you will see much better in the following picture.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Fuse blocks: mounted</p><p>Done! Done?</p>
<p>You are forgetting, my Dear Reader. We here are in the <em>misery</em> business. Look carefully at the curvature of the fuselage. Imagine the
side panel, open on the pictures, closed over our &quot;conduit&quot;, on which the fuse blocks are installed. Do you see how the available &quot;depth&quot;
will be bigger in the middle of the conduit as compared to the top?</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>Of course, the panel won't close. With fuses installed, they would rub on the side panel. Not Good.</p>
<p>But relocating them down? What's the problem? Bowden cables, of course! I'd be too close to them, and I wanted very much to isolate my
wire bundle and my bowdens; but even if I didn't, I still won't have enough room there for a terminal, and a nice 90 degree &quot;turn&quot; for the
wire to go sideways (either towards the panel, or towards the firewall).</p>
<p>Solution?</p>
<p>Well.. there weren't any good ones, so I ended up taking the best of the crappy ones.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Final fuseblock mount locations</p><p>Not ideal, because they're flipped over - so <em>technically</em>, condensation can run down and into the fuse socket. Not a good situation to be
in, but I can't do anything here. I guess, inspecting this area for corrosion is going to be on my Regular Maintenance List.</p>
<p>Oh, and I ended up with four <em>extra</em> perfectly drilled and deburred holes, right in the passenger's cockpit. That's what is on the other side
of that &quot;conduit&quot;.</p>
<p>I guess, I will attach a placard to them stating that those are &quot;hole samples&quot; or something (my friend Dick Gossen placarded a missing screw in his instrument panel once,
so I figure I am allowed as well).</p>

<h2>Oil Cooler Bowden</h2>
<p>When <a class="reference external" href="http://79ft.net/entries/2019-09-08-fwf-side-channel-panel-layouts/">headscratching about</a>, and later
<a class="reference external" href="http://79ft.net/entries/2019-10-09-vr-mounted/">installing the voltage regulator</a>, Oil Cooler Air Shutoff Valve bowden was relocated
(and because of that, I had to use a longer Bowden, which, gladly, I had an extra of after removing the Rotec's Throttle Body Injector).</p>
<p>All that was left was cut it to size, and install it into the valve's pivot arm.</p>
<p>Cutting bowdens? I don't know, I think it's easy. Pull out the actual control wire, and use bolt cutters. Push the wire back in, and trim
to desired length.</p>
<p>Done.</p>
<p>Here's the pivot arm.</p>

<p>The other minor problem? The hole that clamps the &quot;eye&quot; that holds the bowden's outer housing in place was drilled too close to the place
where the eye begins. Result? Flat washer was too big to lay flat.</p>

<hr class="dashed"/><p>While waiting for someone else to get back to me to help me finish &lt;the thing that took last month and a half
and  is yet to be written about&gt;, I decided to work on the panel a bit.</p>
<p>Lighting strip seemed like a nice place to start.</p>
<p>It's a simple LED strip that I planned to glue right behind coaming on the underside of the eyebrow. This way, it'd be
invisible from pretty much any angle.</p>
<p>But, the wires! The wires in <em>front</em> of the panel, that have to go to the behinds.. No worries I thought, I'd make  a small
hole / slit in the top of the panel, also invisible - and fish the wires thru there.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2020-01-29-light-and-compass/lc-1.jpg" title="The Plan" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2020-01-29-light-and-compass/lc-1-thumb.jpg" title="The Plan" alt="The Plan" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">The Plan</p><p>That was the plan.</p>
<p>Reality, of course, decided to disagree.</p>
<p>The plan was to take out all the screws that went around the top of the panel, and tilt it &quot;down&quot; - so that I
could use a drill comfortably to make the little slit for the wires.</p>
<p>Couple screws came out nice.</p>
<p>I think the third one came out like...</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2020-01-29-light-and-compass/lc-2.jpg" title="?!" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2020-01-29-light-and-compass/lc-2-thumb.jpg" title="?!" alt="?!" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">?!</p><p>Did I just bust a screw? I looked into the hole. <em>Empty?!</em></p>
<p>Upon further examination, I found... glue? What? The screw head was... glued into the hole? That's a first.</p>
<p>After taking the rest of the screws out, I realized what happened.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2020-01-29-light-and-compass/lc-3.jpg" title="Backside of the panel" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2020-01-29-light-and-compass/lc-3-thumb.jpg" title="Backside of the panel" alt="Backside of the panel" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Backside of the panel</p><p>This is the back side of the panel. The panel is attached thru those little tabs and nutplates.</p>
<p>Notice the nutplates using rigid (not floating) style nuts? A slight misdrilling of the holes in the panel, and screws
won't go in at all.</p>
<p>So, there were two &quot;screws&quot; that were just heads glued in - yep - and two more that used #6 screw in a #8 nut - the TPI on those is the same, and the holes were drilled sufficiently close enough to let a #6 screw pass thru; but not a #8. Le.. Sigh.</p>
<p>To top it all off, the panel won't fold down for me to get access to where I wanted to be, and to fish it out I'd have to take
out the carb heat bowden cable that was attached to it. Too much trouble if I can avoid it (that carb heat cable would've
been a 3-4 hour affair just by itself).</p>
<p>Plan B solidified; but first the panel had to be put back.</p>
<p>I ended up putting #6 screws into all the misdrilled holes (sorry, but glueing heads into holes is.. not my thing :)); but I installed nuts on them on the back. Effectively, set up like this the nutplates don't do anything - just add weight. See
the picture above - it has the nut over that nutplate. That nut, by the way, was a pain to get in - see how close another nut is to it?</p>
<p>I think all the fiddling with the panel, screws, nuts, washers (losing a few of them and going on fishing expedition
to pull them out of the guts of the plane included, of course), and trying to get it back in right took what.. around 6 hours?</p>
<p>The plan B, now executable after the panel was back in, was to route the wire under the eyebrow, and fish it thru behind
the coaming to the &quot;top&quot; side right in the middle, where the compass was to be. It then would join the compass light
wire, and go to behind the panel land.</p>
<p>So, the strip was glued, and the wire attached to under the eyebrow with <em>HVAC duct sealing tape</em>, ahem, aircraft grade
glue backed aluminum sheeting from the local friendly Aerospace Depot.</p>

an inspection mirror the only view. Like this:</p>
