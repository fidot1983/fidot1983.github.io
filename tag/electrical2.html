<hr class="dashed"/><p>Prior to mounting the <a class="reference external" href="https://79ft.net/entries/2019-09-30-brake-line/">newly finished brake line</a>, I wanted to finish
fastening everything that's around it - so that I minimize wrenching around the brand new line.</p>
<p>Voltage Regulator is one of the bits that will go right there, so it was to be done.</p>
<p>I was working on it's mounting, on and off, and eventually got stuck with <a class="reference external" href="https://79ft.net/entries/2019-10-08-good-crimps/">attempting to solder a short grounding
strap</a> that was to go under one of the &quot;standoffs&quot; for the regulator.</p>
<p>And then, I was making the new brake line - but now that is done too. I also figured out how
to make that ground strap. So. nothing prevented me from completing the voltage regulator install.</p>
<p>But, we're getting ahead of ourselves.</p>
<p>First, the holes.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-10-09-vr-mounted/vr-2.jpg" title="Holes" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-10-09-vr-mounted/vr-2-thumb.jpg" title="Holes" alt="Holes" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Holes</p><p>How do you drill real good, round, quality holes, you ask?</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-10-09-vr-mounted/vr-3.jpg" title="Tools!" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-10-09-vr-mounted/vr-3-thumb.jpg" title="Tools!" alt="Tools!" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Tools!</p><p>Well. All those tools were participating in making of those holes, in sequence. Here's a game: name that sequence!</p>
<p>And then, the mounts. The regulator was to be on standoffs, to &quot;raise&quot; it above that rivet line.
The regulator wants two grounds, which will go under two of the standoffs. I also wanted to have a ground strap go under
a standoff.</p>
<p>Now, I have to explain the ground strap. I already mentioned spending quality time trying to make it.</p>
<p>I want to set up good grounding architecture in my all new electrical. This side conduit, to which the regulator is mounting, is key.</p>
<p>It's continuous, and aluminum - so it presents a really nice grounding point. I am planning to add jumpers between it and the
firewall, and it and the instrument panel, tying it all up nicely. Loads will be grounded to the conduit, firewall,
and instrument panel only.</p>
<p>Since the voltage regulator is right next to the firewall, it's very logical to have the ground strap under one of it's stands. And besides, there is already
a convenient hole right next to it for the firewall side of the grounding strap - which is why the strap is very short.</p>
<p>At any rate, those three terminals under three out of four standoffs for the regulator are making  hardware stacks of varying
thicknesses per standoff, so standoffs need to be individually sized to keep the regulator overall &quot;level&quot; above the conduit.</p>
<p>Another fly in the ointment is that &quot;jog&quot; created by one portion of the conduit riveted on top of another - that has to be
accounted for, too.</p>
<p>So four individual standoffs.</p>

<hr class="dashed"/><p>A while back, I wrote a
<a class="reference external" href="https://79ft.net/entries/2019-09-07-hf-crimper/">note on my failures at getting good crimps with the hydraulic crimper I had</a>.</p>
<p>My conclusion then was, &quot;solder&quot;.</p>
<p>Well, I tried :). I had to make a little bonding strap, maybe 5 inches long.</p>
<p>First time, I cowboyed it - just stuck the strap into the terminal, and soldered away.</p>
<p>In. My. Face.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">One of the better ones</p><p>I eventually started using the &quot;wedge&quot; trick - to wedge a piece of thick wire in between

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Back side</p><p>My main problem was, I was trying to prevent solder wicking as much as I could. And I couldn't.
It would make 1 inch or more of the wire perceivably &quot;crusty&quot;, and I still won't have the barrel
filled in. Remember, I was trying to make a small, short grounding strap, that had to be flexible
to bend almost 180 degrees. I was trying to achieve a &quot;crimp quality&quot; break between solid metal
and strands, and could not.</p>
<p>When I started thinking about it like that, I realized that what I'm trying to do is likely impossible.</p>
<p>Solder will wick - you can control how much with technique and practice, but you can't prevent it.
So my current thinking is, if you solder your large lugs, be ready to support first few inches
of wire really well, so that that &quot;crusty&quot; portion of it doesn't move.</p>
<p>So, I tried to Hail Mary the crimps again. Previously, I had them just damn ugly (I linked the
article above).</p>
<p>I got a small anvil tool (the kind you insert the barrel of the terminal and whack a pin with a
hammer) from Spruce. Thought, 25 bucks was worth a try.</p>
<p>Those crimps were even uglier. I don't know what I expected - I guess that was an act of desperation?
I didn't even take a single picture.</p>
<p>But then... I had a minor epiphany.</p>
<p>With the Harbor Freight Crimper, dies are not properly ground for wire sizes. But. But.</p>
<p>Just like with hammering, we can crimp progressively until we &quot;flow&quot; all the strands and the barrel
into one solid piece!</p>
<p>Here's the approach (okay, this is the <em>final</em> procedure, first try did not include turning - but I
did it (admittedly, accidentally), and liked the results a lot).</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Given wire gauge of, say, 6</li>
<li>Use die 2 sizes up - so, die marked for #2 wire</li>
<li>Put the wire in the terminal. Start by squeezing the terminal turned 90 degrees (so &quot;side to side&quot; rather then &quot;top to bottom&quot;). Just give it a gentle oval shape</li>
<li>Now, turn it 90 degrees and squeeze until the jaws close</li>
<li>At this point, you will have a somewhat <em>undercrimped</em> joint, as I described in my notes on the crimper; but it's shape will be a perfect hex.</li>
<li>Now, go 1 size &quot;down&quot; (so, dies marked for #4 wire). Squeeze.</li>
<li>Stop when you feel it's done shrinking.</li>
</ul>

<hr class="dashed"/><p>...this is important. Stick a pin in it.</p>
<p>Remo had these nice placards all over the airplane. Professionally done. Very well looking. He probably ordered them
somewhere, or used a technique I am not aware of.</p>
<p>These placards are mostly glued on, and do not come off.</p>
<p>How do I know?</p>
<p>Well, I needed to remove <em>one</em>, in the side conduit. Here it is,..</p>

one on the picture. And I can't rip it off! I can't remove the conduit to immerse it into whatever solvent will cut the glue
without some major surgery, so I guess the new fuse block will go on top of it.</p>

<p>Ha!</p>
<p>You'll see.</p>

<h2>Switch Anti-Rotation Holes</h2>
<p>You have probably figured by now that I have a taste for misery, and for ranting about how miserable that or this was :). If
you read a <em>few</em> notes in this Dear Diary, you will notice a trend - that I tend to come up with ways  of making myself
aggravated, very consistently and reliably.</p>
<p>Well, this time it was the &quot;anti-rotation&quot; holes for switches in the panel; and the plan was to drill them from
the <em>back side</em> of the panel <em>not quite all the way thru</em> (yay, no access and contortionism again!)</p>
<p>Every switch, circuit breaker, and certainly, a dimmer, comes with a &quot;keyed&quot; washer to prevent it's rotation. That means
you're drilling two holes - one for the appliance (switch, or whatever), and the other for the little tab that's on the
washer.</p>
<p>Picture explains this better. Here is a little hole template I quickly drew in Solidworks, properly dimensioned,
with washers from (left to right) the circuit breaker, switch, and the dimmer.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-09-10-panel-holes-compass/p-2.jpg" title="Holes template" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-09-10-panel-holes-compass/p-2-thumb.jpg" title="Holes template" alt="Holes template" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Holes template</p><p>See, Remo didn't have those &quot;secondary&quot; holes on the panel - so I had to drill them (especially for the dimmer).</p>
<p>But wait, you ask. If you drill holes, that will be ugly - a hole next to every switch?</p>
<p>Yup. Aha. Agreed! Though the nuts are supposed to cover them, they, I'm pretty sure, from my testing at least, wouldn't
have...</p>
<p>No problem! Remo made the panel from 1/8&quot; thick aluminum, and I needed maybe <em>half</em> that much for the tabs to go in. So
the plan was to very carefully drill them just deep enough to house the tabs.</p>
<p>Made me a nice little set of templates...</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-09-10-panel-holes-compass/p-3.jpg" title="Templates in the making" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-09-10-panel-holes-compass/p-3-thumb.jpg" title="Templates in the making" alt="Templates in the making" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Templates in the making</p><p>...out of a small piece of aluminum, drilled holes using my paper template, and cut them up...</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-09-10-panel-holes-compass/p-4.jpg" title="Templates, cut up" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-09-10-panel-holes-compass/p-4-thumb.jpg" title="Templates, cut up" alt="Templates, cut up" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Templates, cut up</p><p>...and cleaned up the holes and edges.</p>
<p>The plan was, to put a template like a &quot;washer&quot; around a switch/CB/..., and center punch the secondary, small, hole, thru it.
Then, I'll have punch marks to drill, and will have to either get to them from the side of the plane, or, more likely, from the <em>back</em> of
the panel while sitting in the seat and <em>not seeing where they are while drilling</em>, using a mirror to position the drill
first.</p>
<p>Like I said, I have a taste for misery.</p>
<p>So there we went, punching the back side.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Center-punching on the back side of the panel</p><p>Click-clickity-clack.</p>
<p>Cling! Ding! Ding dang dong.. it sounded like a chunk of metal just fell off the plane and dropped on the cockpit floor.</p>
<p>!??!?&#64;??!??! <em>What the h... did I break?!</em></p>
<p>I crawled out from behind the panel and looked into the cockpit.</p>
<p>On the floor, looking at me, and almost smiling, was...</p>

   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-09-10-panel-holes-compass/p-18-thumb.jpg" title="Placard!" alt="Placard!" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Placard!</p><p>...this. Remo's placard that went around the switches. Like so:</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-09-10-panel-holes-compass/p-2-3.jpg" title="Placards - in place" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-09-10-panel-holes-compass/p-2-3-thumb.jpg" title="Placards - in place" alt="Placards - in place" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Placards - in place</p><p>Wait, wait wait wait. It came <em>off</em>. But it will be held back by the switches' nuts when the switches are in. And.. cover
the holes! That means, I don't need to drill the holes from the back side and worry about punching thru (or not going deep enough) - I can comfortably sit in the cockpit and
drill them from the front! All the way thru! The placard will cover them! In my search for misery, did I luck out?! :)</p>
<p>In retrospect, this (and the opposite side's) placard were probably not glued. No need - switches' nuts hold them just fine.</p>
<p>They were stuck because Remo probably installed them on top of the paint that didn't fully cure - and it just stuck to the backside
of placards over the years, under the pressure from switches' nuts.</p>
<p>I stuck my nail under the opposite side placard, and it came off with a little force.</p>
<p>Ha!</p>
<p>Well, it was smooth sailing from there...</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Marking from the front</p><p>... relatively speaking, of course. I still had to hold up the vacuum with my knee, and maneuver the sharp drill,
making sure to be extra careful not to poke it into anything important (like, fabric on the sides).</p>

<h2>Dimmer Pot</h2>
<p>That sucker has 1/4&quot; diameter threads; and all the holes I have in the panel are 1/2... Without some serious bushings, or
other mods, or a new hole.. ugh.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Possible pot locations</p><p>I was hoping to stick it into the old &quot;Master Circuit Breaker&quot; hole (marked (2) above), but it was waaaay too big.</p>
<p>Looking around, looking around.... aha! Here's a number 8 or 10 screw plugging a hole! I can enlarge it and we'll be
in business! (marked (1)).</p>
<p>Yep. Good luck, buddy. That was an even <em>bigger</em> hole that was plugged with a #8 screw in a countersunk finishing
washer... hmmm... maybe that will work out for the pot too?</p>
<p>You know, drilling a #10 countersunk washer to have a 1/4&quot; hole in it is... hard? Annoying? You can't really grip
it in any manner without damaging it, you can't hold it in your fingers... I think I lucked out on my third try, with combination
of a Unibit and light clamping of that washer in a vice.</p>
<p>With that re-drilled countersunk washer, the pot mounts just fine in hole #2. And #1 got plugged back :).</p>

<h2>Compass Mount</h2>
<p>Well, after all that excitement compass mount was almost anti climactic. I toyed with the idea of putting it into the panel
(and relocating G-meter into a new hole I'd cut around where the ignition switch was - see, after
<a class="reference external" href="https://79ft.net/entries/2019-09-08-fwf-side-channel-panel-layouts/">having failed relocating Hobbs there</a>, the idea of still
making a bigger hole in the panel keeps nagging me :).</p>
<p>No good. When that much down, too much steel around it confuses the compass to the tune of about 30 degrees... No need to
add extra problems in already a magnetically problematic plane.</p>
<p>So, top it was to be. The windshield will get in the way, but I really, really didn't want to take it off (~20 #6
screws and nuts in a tight spot is no fun).</p>
<p>Eyeballed the bracket alignment with the fuselage centerline and put it in the right spot...</p>
<p>Damn! Sharpie's too tall to get in there to mark the holes <em>vertically</em>. &quot;Angle Sharpie Adapter&quot;... hmm..</p>

<hr class="dashed"/><p>I was on the fence about making this entry as multiple separate ones versus just one giant one... After all, it covers
quite a few, mostly unrelated, things that I did in the last few days, and it would've made sense to keep
them separate.</p>
<p>However; finally decided to make just one big article with all of them. None of them are finished; but somewhat a decent
chunk of work is - I think I have <em>mostly</em> figured out where everything will go and how it will all come together.</p>

<li>Main Connector is gone. I was convinced that reliability concerns outweigh the benefits of having it. Plus, I have very

<li>Physically, it's easier to hook up the LR3C Sense wire to a different spot - on the Shunt stud rather than to the
Master Contactor/Starter Contactor jumper directly. It makes no difference, it's the same circuit - just a different hookup spot to it.</li>

<h2>Firewall Forward</h2>
<p>I started trying things around firewall forward while
<a class="reference external" href="https://79ft.net/entries/2019-09-01-carb-cables/">figuring out routing and lengths for carb control cables</a>, and continued
afterwards.</p>

<h4>Contactors</h4>
<p>It became obvious fairly quickly that I won't be able to use the nice B&amp;C Starter Contactor because of it's mounting
holes not being the same as a very common SS581 Starter Solenoid that was set up by Remo. Also, the way terminals
were set up on the B&amp;C Starter Contactor would have made them closer to the carb control cables. And, I didn't want to drill more
holes in the firewall.</p>

things up.</p>
<p>And because it doesn't have the spike catcher diode, I had to get me a couple IN5400s, and soldered an extension lead to one
of them.</p>

<h4>Battery and Starter Wires</h4>
<p>Those are the thickest wires, and routing them is more complicated than the other ones. In addition, the
battery + -&gt; master contactor wire is the only wire that can't be turned off, and therefore needs to be very well
thought out and as short as possible.</p>
<p>Here's something else, too. The Charger was set up to ground the battery to the motor. So far, so good - starter is by far
the largest consumer in the electrical system. However, nothing was done to ground the motor to the rest of the airplane!</p>
<p>So the rest of the system was probably grounded via whatever metal to metal connections there were on the motor.
Control cables and braided fuel and oil hoses? ;) Airbox bowden &quot;carb heat&quot; cable... I can't think of much more else.</p>
<p>Initially, I was planning to run a ground strap braid from the battery negative to one of the bolts holding the battery
box to the firewall, but with fuel system components and control cables around, just couldn't figure out a good way to run
it and support it. I had to end up settling for running it to the engine mount instead.</p>
<p>So the bottom line is, the negative 4GA cable is gonna go to the motor, and parallel to it a braid will go to the motor mount.
I also figured out a clamp arrangement with some standoffs that will keep the wires neat and organized.</p>

that, it would not let the ANL covers to come on. So, before doing anything drastic, I decided to check to see how it
would look with the wire jumpers</p>

<h2>Side Conduit</h2>
<p>The Voltage Regulator and the Main Terminal/Fuse Block were to go to the Side Conduit running alongside the fuselage.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Rough component locations</p><p>I had to relocate the bowdens lower to free up some space.  The Oil Cooler box on this plane is all sorts of weird, including a flapper valve controlled by one of those bowdens that closes up the airflow to it (which is not enough to begin with; being a 1.5&quot; SCAT takeoff off of back baffle.. but don't get me started on that). That cable turned out to be too short when
relocated - but I lucked out - Glenn had a bowden going to the Rotec TBI that I removed for &quot;prime&quot; function, and that bowden was plenty
long. I'll trim it to final length when I'm done in that side conduit.</p>
<p>The brake tube was running inside the conduit, and I will have to relocate it to run below the conduit and be supported
by adel clamps. For now, I unhooked it and used it to somewhat mock up the new run. Tube and fittings ordered,
and tubing bender already here!</p>
<div class="section" id="fuse-block">
<h3>Fuse Block</h3>
<p>I was gonna use a 20-position fuse block from B&amp;C. Well, <em>that</em> didn't go too well.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Fuse block</p><p>Tight! I basically lose the whole top row of fuses with it. Not enough room....</p>
<p>After poking around the Internets for a bit, came to these nice fuse blocks made by Blue Sea Systems. Longest ones they
have are 8 fuses, so I will need two (if I recall correctly, I have 13 fuses in the diagram currently, and I want some spare
positions for later if I need them).</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Blue Sea Systems fuse block</p><p>Much better! Plus, they use ring terminals rather than tabs - and while tabs are light and simple, I don't like them.
Removing them is hard, and, when removed, the terminal loses a lot of it's grip. It's almost like an &quot;assemble once&quot; type
deal.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="voltage-regulator">
<h3>Voltage Regulator</h3>
<p>With how the wire harness is gonna go in that conduit, and with bowdens being where they are, the best orientation for the
Voltage Regulator would've been &quot;upside down&quot;, with terminal strip up.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-09-08-fwf-side-channel-panel-layouts/cond-7.jpg" title="Upside Down orientation" >

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Upside Down orientation</p><p>Damn you, the yellow sticker on the regulator! DAMN you! (hint: read it :) ).</p>
<p>Mounting it sideways, I'd have a line of rivet heads under it - which I didn't want to deal with.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Sideways orientation</p><p>And mounting it down... Down was annoying because of the clamp for bowdens and bowdens close there. That would also
complicate wiring.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Down orientation</p><p>Upside down would've been perfect... except for that yellow sticker :). So, I decided to Hail Mary and asked nice folks at
B&amp;C about what they thought.</p>
<p>See, the problem is I know why they wanted the terminal strip to be pointed down. It's so that water won't get into the
box in case of condensation accumulating on it. But I thought, maybe I can seal it somehow?</p>
<p>The answer from TJ at B&amp;C was a resounding no. Right side up, sideways - but not upside down.</p>
<p>So I mocked up the right side up mounting...</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-09-08-fwf-side-channel-panel-layouts/cond-12.jpg" title="Right side up mockup" >

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Right side up mockup</p><p>Yuck. Yeah; it'd work; but it's ugly as hell.</p>
<p>The only other option would be sideways, but on &quot;standoffs&quot; of sorts to clear the rivet heads. I mentioned that to TJ, and he
said that that could work, but I should check if I can access the voltage adjustment screw on the top of the box.</p>
<p>Damn it! I forgot about it. On the top of the box there's a plug over a hole that opens up access to a tiny screw to adjust
buss voltage - basically, to fine tune how much volts the battery sees. Not something you do often, but you want to be able
to do it.</p>
<p>But then, TJ mentioned that he saw the holes in the firewall and that might be the saving grace.</p>
<p>Bingo!</p>
<p>I tried it out again in vertical, now with mocked up standoffs</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Vertical</p><p>With just enough aggravation due to bad access (mandatory in aviation pretty much), you can undo the bolt covering the hole
in the firewall (this hole was left over from the brake line relocation), pop the plug on the voltage regulator, and
just have enough access to the adjustment screw.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Unsightly hole</p><p>... and I thought, maybe I could put the Hobbs back there?</p>
<p>My initial tests with one of the  2 1/4 gauges I have removed seemed to have been okay: there was <em>just enough</em> room
in there to get another 2 1/4 gauge in.</p>
<p>So, I got me a very nice panel punch that could make a nice, round, clean hole in place.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Instrument Hole Punch</p><p>Well, next was to remove the Hobbs from the front panel. <em>That</em> was an hour of contortionism. The Hobbs is
held by an aluminum backplate and
four nylock nuts, so I <em>had</em> to have a wrench over them the <em>whole</em> time. Oh, the screws are way too long BTW, so taking all
them out took about five times more turns than it should've, while I was wondering if my wrists will take this much
flexing, twisting, and bending any longer.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Mounting ring</p><p>This is a pic from the fuel quantity gauge held in the same manner, but here he's using brass flat type nuts that you can
hold with your fingers. On the Hobbs, it was nylocks.</p>
<p>Anyway, I got it out.  And then, started setting up for punching that hole.
Removed VSI to give me a bit more room to work with.</p>
<p>I tried to reconstruct exactly what happened next in my memory to write it down here, and could not.
I was basically fiddling, checking clearances, making sure I'll be able to hook up the punch and center the hole, have
enough room for the mounting ring in the back and clear everything I had to clear, when I discovered that...</p>
<p>The Hobbs was <em>not</em> a standard 2 1/4 inch gauge - it was a touch <em>bigger</em>. So the hole that I would've made would've been
too small for it. And that if I punched the hole, I would've been just left with a bigger hole and nothing to
put in there.</p>
<p>Damn, damn, damn! Damn you, assumptions that every &quot;small&quot; gauge on an airplane is 2 1/4!</p>
<p>And I had the expensive punch that I had no use for :(.</p>
<p>Oh well. Thanks God I actually did <em>not</em> do it - only to have a <em>larger</em> hole to plug up. I guess, that Hobbs is (thru
more contortionism) going back to the front panel.</p>

<div class="section" id="the-crimper">
<h2>The Crimper</h2>
<p>Normally, crimpers for large size terminals are super expensive; but Harbor Freight, as usual, sells
a hydraulic crimper with large dies for just about fifty bucks.</p>
<p>Here it is, in it's full glory.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Dies</p><p>Technically, the way it's designed is it's supposed to produce these nice hexagonal crimps. Or at least, I think that's
what they were trying to do.</p>
<p>But those familiar with crimpers know that the key is in good dies; and that's were most of the money is. Damn, &quot;regular&quot;
stripping dies for StripMaster are what, $10; while milspec dies are what, $150? Now; of course there's diminishing
returns there - in the case of StripMaster, regular dies work just fine for most applications.</p>
<p>Here's the problem with HF Crimper dies. The holes in them are severely <strong>undersized</strong>, which makes them produce &quot;flat&quot;,
rather than hexagonal crimps. We can't know if this is by design. What I tried to do is to research what others are doing,
and to run a few &quot;is this a good crimp&quot; tests.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-test-setup">
<h2>The Test Setup</h2>
<p>I was crimping chunks of 8 AWG MIL-W-22759/16 wire into AMP Battery Terminals.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">The Terminal</p><p>After crimping, the terminals were hacksawed in the middle of the crimp, and polished to see if there were any voids or
visible wire strands. A good crimp must be &quot;gas tight&quot;. In other words, all the metal has to be pushed together hard
enough to become a <em>single</em> piece of metal for all intents and purposes.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="using-8-awg-dies">
<h2>Using 8 AWG dies</h2>
<p>For baseline, I used the HF die marked for 8 AWG.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">8 AWG die / crimp</p><p>As you can see, using the &quot;nominal&quot; die produces this weird, flattish-with-a-bulge crimp. What's worse is it adds this
strange &quot;jog&quot; to the terminal lengthwise, and scrapes the metal inward where the crimp starts. That's lots of stress
risers.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">8 AWG die / cutaway</p><p>The crimp quality is good though. There are a few specks of shavings I didn't clean off - those are not defects.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="using-6-awg-dies">
<h2>Using 6 AWG Dies</h2>
<p>I went next size up, to dies marked for 6 AWG. That produced the same crimp as for 8 AWG, but with &quot;wings&quot; being thinner -
almost paper-thin. I also didn't like how it mangled the terminal even more.</p>
<p>Somebody online mentioned that they rotated the crimp 90 degrees and did it again to &quot;push the wings in&quot; and I tried that.</p>

<h2>Using 4 AWG Dies</h2>
<p>Finally, I tried 4 AWG dies.</p>

   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-09-07-hf-crimper/c-7-thumb.jpg" title="4 AWG die / crimp" alt="4 AWG die / crimp" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">4 AWG die / crimp</p><p>This crimp almost looks good. The jog is almost not there, and it has nice hexagonal shape. &quot;Wings&quot; are almost not present.</p>
<p>However, the dies closed fully and it felt to me that the metal was not compressed enough (I recall the resistance I felt
in the crimper doing the previous two tests, and the resistance I felt on this one was much less).</p>
<p>The cutaway confirmed that.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">4 AWG die / cutaway</p><p>Those imperfections on the cutaway are voids left from not enough compression force applied.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="conclusion">
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Well, it's a sad one really. If you want to use the HF tool, then you probably should use dies that make those &quot;winged&quot;
style crimps (like the one produced in my first test), and suck up the jog and other imperfections.</p>
<p>I have posted my findings on AeroElectric list, and the conclusions seems to be supported - the dies are horrible, and to
make them real good one would need to rework them significantly.</p>

<div class="section" id="update-october-2019">
<h2>Update - October 2019</h2>
<p>After <a class="reference external" href="https://79ft.net/entries/2019-10-08-good-crimps/">trying and failing the soldering approach</a>, I have devised a technique of using this crimper to achieve
good results. Musings linked in the previous sentence, and here's the jist:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Given wire gauge of, say, 6</li>
<li>Use die 2 sizes up - so, die marked for #2 wire</li>
<li>Put the wire in the terminal. Start by squeezing the terminal turned 90 degrees (so &quot;side to side&quot; rather then &quot;top to bottom&quot;). Just give it a gentle oval shape</li>
<li>Now, turn it 90 degrees and squeeze until the jaws close</li>
<li>At this point, you will have a somewhat <em>undercrimped</em> joint, as I described in my notes on the crimper; but it's shape will be a perfect hex.</li>
<li>Now, go 1 size &quot;down&quot; (so, dies marked for #4 wire). Squeeze.</li>
<li>Stop when you feel it's done shrinking.</li>
</ul>

<hr class="dashed"/><p>So most orders have been placed, and a lot of them have arrived already. (Note to self: need to take pictures of all the stuff).</p>
<p>The first thing to be worked on is the heart - the alternator.</p>
<p>Look at this little beauty!</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">B&C L-40</p><p>Tiny, light as a feather, and cute as a button! No, sir, this thing has to get attached to the nose!</p>
<p>The old one needs to come off. Pivot arm bolt undone. Pivot bold undone.</p>
<p>Wait. The pivot bolt can't get out, because the flywheel gets in the way...</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Pivot bolt and interference</p><p>Hmm.. No, I can't believe Remo pulled the flywheel off of crank just to install the alternator. There must be a better
way.</p>

   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-08-16-alternator-fitting/a-6-thumb.jpg" title="The better way - bracket attach bolts!" alt="The better way - bracket attach bolts!" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">The better way - bracket attach bolts!</p><p>Aha! This is case mount, and the bracket is attached to the motor case. Let's see... Yep! It came off.</p>
<p>Now, the new bracket... centers nicely!</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-08-16-alternator-fitting/a-8.jpg" title="New bracket" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-08-16-alternator-fitting/a-8-thumb.jpg" title="New bracket" alt="New bracket" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">New bracket</p><p>See that ear on the right, that touches the starter boss? That one needs to attach to the starter, to prevent
the bracket flexing left and right. It lines up great, but, problem number one (but I knew this one), the old
alternator bracket didn't have that. Remo used that hole on the starter boss to hook up the front of the nose &quot;ramp&quot; part of
the baffle:</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-08-16-alternator-fitting/a-2.jpg" title="Baffle attach bracket" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-08-16-alternator-fitting/a-2-thumb.jpg" title="Baffle attach bracket" alt="Baffle attach bracket" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Baffle attach bracket</p><p>No matter. I will just bend up a new one, to account for the thickness of the new bracket's &quot;ear&quot; that will get sandwiched
between this baffle attach bracket, and the starter boss. Material already ordered!</p>
<p>Now, let's test fit the belt, and the new pivot arm. The belt, the belt.. oh wait. Yep. The prop needs to come off - but this
is a non-event now (and I am not leaving the prop off again -
<a class="reference external" href="https://79ft.net/entries/2019-05-17-race-for-the-engine/">learned that one already</a>). I'm becoming quite good at
this prop pulling business....</p>
<p>Belt on and prop back on, test-fitting the pivot arm... CRUD!</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-08-16-alternator-fitting/a-10.jpg" title="Pivot arm" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-08-16-alternator-fitting/a-10-thumb.jpg" title="Pivot arm" alt="Pivot arm" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Pivot arm</p><p>That black bracket to the left of it holds the hose &quot;ramp&quot; portion of the baffle..... and, it won't let the damn pivot
arm go in! No way. And no easy modification here - it's interfering, seriously...</p>
<p>Frankly, at that point I went home (this whole note covers quite a few days of work), with thoughts of remaking the
front baffle; and spent the evening researching how baffles are done on planes with similar nosebowl... Frankly,
I don't like how this front baffle is done on this plane (see
<a class="reference external" href="https://79ft.net/entries/2019-05-17-cowling-conundrum/">Cowling Conundrum</a>), and thought of this as being a good
chance to fix it. I moaned about this to my buddy and colleague Dima D (who's helping me here quite a lot with notes
and advice)...</p>
<p>But next nite, I thought that maybe I can get away with remaking just the arm... I am absolutely not set up to do complicated
sheet metal work at the moment...</p>
<p>The old alternator had this weird pivot arm that now made way more sense. It &quot;doglegged&quot; around the bracket with which
the standard pivot arm interfered:</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-08-16-alternator-fitting/a-11.jpg" title="The old pivot arm" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-08-16-alternator-fitting/a-11-thumb.jpg" title="The old pivot arm" alt="The old pivot arm" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">The old pivot arm</p><p>Notice how it has this portion that goes down, and then the pivot arm &quot;turns&quot; left to go under the nose baffle ramp attach
bracket?</p>
<p>That corner is definitely a large stress riser... but this arm held a much heavier Delco-Remy alternator for almost 40 years...
Granted, it's made out of 0.190 steel as opposed to 0.125 steel used in B&amp;C bracket... but I can make a similar one for
the new alternator...</p>
<p>We'll see if we can smooth out that corner so that it's arcing better, reducing stress. If I can, I will use 0.125 steel.
If I can't, I'll settle with 0.190 - just like the old one. We know this works.</p>
<p>Thanks Dima! You were right. For now. I will redo this nose ramp when I'm redoing the motor, later :).</p>
<p>... and now, to the belt. Let's get this nose ramp back on. It has an opening for the belt to pass thru, and a fairing
for the alternator pulley....</p>
<p>Damn. Yep. That one doesn't fit right, either.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-08-16-alternator-fitting/a-13.jpg" title="Nose ramp back on" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-08-16-alternator-fitting/a-13-thumb.jpg" title="Nose ramp back on" alt="Nose ramp back on" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Nose ramp back on</p><p>If you look real careful inside the red circle, you can just see the belt there. It will rub on the left edge of that hole.
It has to go right, which means the alternator has to go down, which means longer belt.</p>
<p>I used a piece of wire to mock this up. Here are a couple of pictures from the back side.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Wire mocking up a longer belt - so that it's centered in the hole</p><p>I ordered a couple of longer belts from the same series, to try them out and see how they will work in the end...</p>
<p>So, where are we at?</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>I will need a new, smaller, bracket for the front support of that nose baffle ramp (the bracket will attach to the starter, same place as before)</li>
<li>I will need to design and make a new pivot arm - and to learn how to make nice slots with hand tools</li>
<li>A different belt</li>
</ul>
<p>Meanwhile, folks at B&amp;C were extremely helpful and generous with their time, reading my long, ranty, emails, and responding
to me with their thoughts. I really appreciated that!</p>

   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-08-11-design-v1/starting-circuit.gif" title="Starting and Mags Circuit" alt="Starting and Mags Circuit" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Starting and Mags Circuit</p><p>This is a deviation from Z-11, with both switches having to be in the momentary up position for starter to engage. I like
this better for two reasons:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>It makes the act of starting the motor more explicit</li>
<li>It returns back to correct &quot;running&quot; position automatically</li>
</ul>
<p>I need to test the ergonomics of pressing up a couple switches together. If I don't like it, another alternative would be
to replace the &quot;Right Mag&quot; switch circuitry from -5 to -1: making the top position on it non-momentary (as noted on the diagram).
This will reduce the &quot;user-friendliness&quot; but will still keep the explicitness, especially with my using pull-to-unlock switches
from Honeywell.</p>

<h3>Main Power Distribution</h3>
<p>The Charging and Buss circuitry excerpt below:</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Power Distribution</p><p>Note that:</p>
<p>Shunt is set up to be in the &quot;battery&quot; lead. I like &quot;battery lead&quot; style ammeters, showing charge current on the 12-o-clock-plus
segment, and discharge current on the 12-o-clock-minus segment.</p>
<p>Note that the buss feeder wire is protected by a slow-burn 35A current limiter. In Z-11, that wire is not protected at all. My
reasoning for this decision is that this wire is relatively long on my plane (around 4 feet), since fuse block is near the
rear cockpit. I wanted to protect it.</p>
<p>One area of concern here is that in the event of alternator short, the Ammeter Shunt will be a part of the alternator circuit that
will see a lot of current while the 40A slow burn opens up. My gutfeel says it should be able to handle it, but I am not sure. At
any rate, figure Z-11 has the same setup with shunt on the alternator's B-Lead.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="voltage-regulator-sense-wire">
<h3>Voltage Regulator Sense Wire</h3>
<p>LR3C Voltage Regulator needs a separate &quot;voltage sense&quot; wire that one would normally connect to the main buss. Since the
regulator in my case is closer to the firewall than to the buss (fuse) block, I am connecting it to the main battery
circuitry (jumper wire between Starter and Master contactors). This is somewhat a shorter run and seems that it will be
more logical to measure as close to the battery as possible (especially since I'm saving on wire lengths this way).
Seems sensible to me.</p>
<p>The sense wire will be 20 AWG, about 3' long, and connected via 24 AWG fuselink.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="voltage-regulator-field-supply-circuit">
<h3>Voltage Regulator Field Supply Circuit</h3>
<p>The circuit looks like this:</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-08-11-design-v1/field-supply.gif" title="Field Supply Circuit" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-08-11-design-v1/field-supply.gif" title="Field Supply Circuit" alt="Field Supply Circuit" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Field Supply Circuit</p><p>I copied the AeroElectric's figure Z-11 wire gauges here. In Z-11, everything upstream of Breaker is 18 AWG, and everything
downstream is 20 AWG, but it's not explained why.</p>
<p>Is this driven by a requirement to ensure that fuselink survives the short in the circuit in case of crowbaring, and the
breaker pops first, w/o endangering the fuselink much (18 AWG allows for 22 AWG fuselink instead of 24 AWG)?</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="components-location-and-main-connector">
<h3>Components Location and Main Connector</h3>
<p>Here's a relative diagram of components location, that is necessary for explaining what Main Connector is. Click it for larger
version.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-08-11-design-v1/component-locations.jpg" title="Key component locations" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-08-11-design-v1/component-locations-thumb.jpg" title="Key component locations" alt="Key component locations" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Key component locations</p><p>Note that logically, the way one would wire this airplane would be to pre-wire switches and other items that go into the
pilot's (back) instrument panel with long pigtails, then install the switches, and tie down wiring behind the panel. Then,
the pigtails can be connected to fuse block and loads.</p>
<p>Some of the load wires already exist (lighting for example), and they will have to be spliced to wires coming from switches.</p>
<p>I have decided instead to locate a kind of &quot;Main Connector&quot;  right there near the Fuse
Block. A wire comes off of the Fuse Block, goes to the switch on the panel, then switched power
is returned to the &quot;Main Connector&quot;. Load is on the other side of Main Connector.</p>
<p>This serves a couple purposes:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Create a logical &quot;access point&quot; into the main wire bundle, for reading labels, tracing wires later, and such</li>
<li>Simplify installation process</li>
<li>Connect to existing load wires that are not being replaced</li>
</ul>
<p>For now, I am thinking about using Molex 0.093 pins in two housings (I have 13 circuits total to connect via this thing,
and want to have room for further expansion). I would love suggestions here. One of the requirements is that it should be
easily workable with a multimeter for tracing / testing purposes (I technically could've used  D-Sub here , but am
not due to this precise reason).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="separate-switch-for-turn-and-bank">
<h3>Separate Switch for Turn and Bank</h3>
<p>Yes, it's weird to have that. The original electrical had it. I guess, the logic was to be able to shed half an amp
of unnecessary load in the event of alternator failure, or it was just done for no good reason.</p>
<p>I'm keeping it :).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="front-panel-tach">
<h3>Front Panel Tach</h3>
<p>It's a <a class="reference external" href="http://www.westach.com/instructions/Y2AT3-2.jpg">Westach gauge</a> that feeds off of a magneto P-Lead.
No separate power going to it.</p>
<p>Westach asks for a 1/4 A inline fuse. But why? Seems unnecessary (we don't need to fuse P-Leads).</p>
<p>Wire going to this tach in my opinion need to be shielded P-Lead wire. Not sure if I'm correct here.</p>
<p>I need to tie into one of the P-Leads. I have three options:</p>
<p><strong>At magneto</strong>: I will effectively have two P-Leads coming off of one of them. I have Bendix mags, and connectors on those
might make the whole hookup look ugly. Adds extra wire.</p>
<p><strong>At mag switch in the rear panel</strong>: just adds extra ~4 feet of wire for no reason.</p>
<p><strong>Y-Split the P-lead as it goes along the fuselage</strong>: this seems the most optimal wire-management wise, but I am not sure if
splicing into a P-lead is kosher. I don't see any good reasons why that would be bad, but I don't know everything.
This will likely be a soldered splice unless I find or someone suggests something better. This is my solution of choice at the
moment.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="panel-lighting">
<h3>Panel Lighting</h3>
<p>I am on the fence on this one. On one hand, I can add a nice LED strip light and dimmer to light the panel up.</p>
<p>On the other hand, this is extra weight, and &quot;this is a biplane! you won't fly it at night!&quot; vs. &quot;well what if you find
yourself out late&quot; keeps nagging me. Note: I do <em>not</em> have a landing light (though in a biplane... that's somewhat
a non-necessity ;) ).</p>
<p>I am leaning towards doing it, because doing it now will be easy, and I will have the option to see my gauges at night, even
if that Dark and Stormy Night will be a result of bad planning rather than an intentional thing.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="awg-feeder-for-radios">
<h3>10 AWG Feeder for Radios</h3>
<p>Radio stack was wired via the &quot;Radio Master&quot; switch prior. I was initially going to run separate power feeds to each of the
things in the radio stack, but to get to it, I'll need to pull the wings off (yeah...). It's in between pilot's legs attached
to the bottom of the cockpit.</p>
<p>So, the feeder is staying. The stack has been wired by previous owner recently, and isn't wired badly - with individual fuses
for each radio, and a 10 AWG feeder to it and ground &quot;return&quot; from it.</p>
<p>I'm just putting this &quot;hose&quot; on a 30A fuse, which is more than enough to protect the wire and support all the loads from that
stack.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="strobe-and-nav-on-the-same-circuit">
<h3>Strobe and Nav on the Same Circuit</h3>
<p>I am replacing (TailNav, WingNav) + (old heavy strobe on belly) with <a class="reference external" href="https://uavionix.com/products/skybeacon/">SkyBeacon</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://uavionix.com/products/skysensor/">SkySensor</a> on wingtips and nav/strobe on the tail, but I don't have enough
wiring in the fuselage and wings to have a separate circuit for  strobes. I do not plan to fly IFR (biplane!) so &quot;strobes in
the clouds&quot; is not really an issue. When I will have the rag off the airplane, I will add a separate switching circuit
for just the strobes.</p>

<hr class="dashed"/><p>Finally, doing some actual work on the airplane, and having fun! And I decided to start logging time.. because, why not!</p>
<div class="section" id="wire-marking">
<h2>Wire Marking</h2>
<p>I like marked wires. I used to be a networking guy, and I was very meticulous about marking every single wire in my cabinets, so that I knew
exactly what was plugged in where.</p>
<p>It took a bit of upfront time, but saved a bunch of it later on.</p>
<p>So naturally, I was planning to do the same on the Charger, and, more importantly, make it look <em>professional</em>.</p>
<p>Thanks to living in this day and age, that is simple. No, I'm not gonna pay someone to laser etch my wires - that's a cop out :). It's like
paying someone to paint your plane.</p>
<p>Instead, I have researched and found a perfect label maker - Brady BMP21 (not including a link here because it will probably go dead after
some time... just search for it). This thing has 3:1 heatshrink tube cartridges.</p>

<div class="section" id="fusible-links">
<h2>Fusible Links</h2>
<p>Every wire must be fused at the source. Well, almost every :). We don't fuse a couple wires like battery - master contactor: but this is
an exception rather than the rule.</p>
<p>Most wires are fused on the fuse block at the main buss. But some wires are impractical or impossible to have hooked up to that. Think ammeter
shunt wires as a classic example.</p>
<p>For those, most people use bulky, ugly, and generally eww-y inline fuses. But there's a better option! Enter fusible links.</p>
<p>The idea is simple: use a short length of wire 4 gauges smaller the wire to be fused. So if your wire to be fused is 20AWG, you would do:</p>
<p>Source -&gt; 24AWG -&gt; 20AWG where the 24AWG segment acts as a fuse. The idea is, in case of a short, that piece will burn first.</p>
<p>So, I wanted to convince myself that that will work fine for me.</p>
<p>Initially, me and my ham neighbor tried to use his ~30 amp power supply to do it. No joy. The best we could do is 22 amps, and (imagine that!) 24
gauge we were trying to burn held up to the abuse with no sweat at all! I could even hold it in my fingers. Yay, milspec wire!</p>
<p>So I decided to go rough. I do have a discarded old  battery, after all. It was time to burn some wires with it.</p>
<p>Here, the red wire is 20AWG, and the black wire is 24AWG. Using crimps for quick setup.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Boom!</p><p>It burnt real quick, in less than a second, and the protected (red) wire barely got hot (I was holding it - that was a part of the test). Yes, say
that I am unscientific all you want - milspec wire holds up to 150C, and I can't hold up to 150C. The 20GA wire got barely warm - which means it
won't cause any problems in a bundle.</p>
<p>It worked!</p>
<p>Now, it was time to set up a real one - to make sure that when the &quot;fuse&quot; wire burns, it doesn't damage anything.</p>
<p>B&amp;C sells very nice fiberglass tubing covered in silicone for exactly this purpose.</p>
<p>I also soldered the fuselink in this time - I wanted to see how well will the solder splices hold to the temps.</p>

<p>I took it off to inspect.</p>

hey - this worked very well indeed!</p>

<div class="section" id="load-measurements">
<h2>Load Measurements</h2>
<p>Prior to ripping the old wiring out, I wanted to take some real life load measurements with various things turned on,
so that I don't get any nasty surprises.</p>
<p>But this plane has no ammeter... damn. I searched around, and found this little doodad:</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-06-18-fuselinks/hamm.jpg" title="Hall Effect ammeter" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-06-18-fuselinks/hamm-thumb.jpg" title="Hall Effect ammeter" alt="Hall Effect ammeter" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Hall Effect ammeter</p><p>Very nice. It basically measures current on the wire passing thru this big white ring using Hall effect. Very cool! No need to splice into
the battery leads and install a temp shunt.</p>
<p>So, I rigged it up and took some numbers.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-06-18-fuselinks/amm-1.jpg" title="Rigged up" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-06-18-fuselinks/amm-1-thumb.jpg" title="Rigged up" alt="Rigged up" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Rigged up</p><ul class="simple">
<li>Master On: 1.5 amps<ul>
<li>Includes: Master Solenoid, and a couple of gauges</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Fuel Pump: 0.2 amps</li>
<li>&quot;Radios&quot; switch (turns on engine monitor, and power to radios: turning backlighting on them): 0.8 amps</li>
<li>I-Com Radio, Transmit: 2.6 amps</li>
<li>Intercom: 0.1 amps</li>
<li>Transponder: 1.1 amps</li>
<li>Smoke Oil pump: 2.2 - 2.6 amps (high on startup)</li>
</ul>
<p>So couple interesting things here. I think the x-der number is too low, but it wasn't being interrogated, and I can't make it be interrogated
without flying the plane or using a transponder tester which I don't have. Also, Master On is too high seemingly...
Will need to double check later and isolate things (master solenoid, hobbs, voltmeter, voltage regulator, fuel gauge) if I care enough - I don't
think I do. Also, fuel pump is too low seemingly. Need to double-check the spec.</p>
<p>And then, I could not turn on the Turn-Slip Indicator...</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="turn-slip-indicator">
<h2>Turn-Slip Indicator</h2>
<p>Sad, sad indicator... see, it's <em>long</em>. And it's wire connector is sticking out. And it's right behind the front seat's headrest, and there's
just not enough room for it, and the connector.</p>
<p>So whomever put it in... did this:</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Sad, sad wiring</p><p>It's hard to see; but basically, those wires are bent &quot;down&quot; at a very sharp 90 degrees angle. Notice how he just used pins without the
actual connector. The distance between them is tiny! I am surprised they haven't shorted over all these years. I really am.</p>
<p>Initially, I thought the gauge didn't turn on because that wiring was all bust up, so to test it, I decided to pull it out.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-06-18-fuselinks/ts-2.jpg" title="On the bench" >

 </a> <p class="small text-center">On the bench</p><p>I cut off the wires with those pins on them to hook it up to my testing battery... hmm.. but I needed some leads! Well, I was gonna
make a bunch of various test leads - so this is as good a time as any! Man, I love soldering...</p>
<p>I long decided to make a bunch of leads with &quot;passthru&quot; banana plugs on one end, and something (a crocodile clamp, a battery clamp,
a ring terminal) on the other. This way, I could mix and match, and plug them into my multimeter; daisy chain, and have multiples
depending on what and how I needed to hook up. I had all the bits (clamps, crocodiles, banana plugs), and even got a roll of very nice super
flexible silicone coated probe wire.</p>

<p>I spun the gyro with my finger.... it spun up!</p>
<p>Well, well. So that gyro &quot;froze&quot; in a bit... Yep, it was hard to turn over with a finger - no doubt a small motor in there had a hard time!</p>
<p>I probably &quot;cleared it up&quot; a bit when turning it over with my fingers - but that won't last long... damn.</p>
<p>Are we looking at the overhaul for this thing too now? Sigh.... Maybe I can find parts
to do that myself, but not so sure about that.... It's not common for owners to overhaul their instruments - they're precision clockwork, after
all...</p>
<p>Oh well.</p>
<p>And I will have to figure out how to solve that wiring problem with no space to hook up the right type connector. I am thinking along the
lines of maybe routing a wire from inside of the gauge down thru a hole I'd drill, a grommet it it, and covering the whole business with
with some sealant or something, so that the dust doesn't get in. we'll see. Need to ponder this a bit more.</p>

<hr class="dashed"/><p>This thing nagged me for a while. The Charger did not have the Field breaker.
For that matter, it didn't have the Alternator master breaker, either.</p>
<p>It had this weird &quot;main buss&quot; breaker for 60 amps, but that didn't look
like the Alternator breaker to me.</p>
<p>So in between dealing with other things after having decided to
put her thru <a class="reference external" href="/category/chickenhouse-charger2019-annual.html">Annual in 2019</a>
a bit early, I was running around with my multimeter, tracing wires.</p>
<p>Initially, I quickly discovered that some lines were definitely not fused;
like Battery -&gt; Main Buss line, and thought I'd put inline fuses
into them, and be done.</p>
<p>She has an old charging system; a <em>mechanical</em> switching voltage regulator, and
a Delco Remy alternator seemingly from a tractor:</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-05-16-fire-hazard/fh-1.jpg" title="The old Delco-Remy" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-05-16-fire-hazard/fh-1-thumb.jpg" title="The old Delco-Remy" alt="The old Delco-Remy" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">The old Delco-Remy</p><p>Voltage regulator didn't make sense. It had 4 wires (should be 2: supply and
field output, or 3: supply, sense, and field output).</p>
<p>Alternator didn't make sense. Instead of 1 wire for Field input, it had
two wires.</p>
<p>Additionally, Battery Contactor didn't make sense. One terminal had a wire
going to it. The other was grounded....</p>
<div class="section" id="interlude">
<h2>Interlude</h2>
<p>Battery Contactor is an interesting point here. Normally, one terminal
is connected to the &quot;always hot&quot; side of it (basically, directly to the battery)
and the other goes to the Master Switch. Master Switch turns the Battery
Contactor on by grounding that wire, providing the negative side to the circuit.
It's a safety thing. If that wire breaks, it'll either turn the electrical off
(open circuit), or it will keep it turned on (short to ground). That's it.</p>
<p>But, one of the terminals on the Battery Contactor was grounded... that means,
that the other terminal (the wire coming from the Master Switch) must provide
positive side??? Huh? But where does it get it's power <em>from</em>?</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="tracing">
<h2>Tracing</h2>
<p>So to tracing we went. I spend maybe 10 hours trying to find diagrams
and understand that alternator and voltage regulator hookups.</p>
<p>And me tracing it spelled my doom.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-diagram">
<h2>The Diagram</h2>
<p>Now, I didn't trace the rest of it. Just the main distribution system. That was
enough.</p>
<p>Shall we?</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-05-16-fire-hazard/fh-2.jpg" title="The current  main power system of the Charger" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-05-16-fire-hazard/fh-2-thumb.jpg" title="The current  main power system of the Charger" alt="The current  main power system of the Charger" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">The current  main power system of the Charger</p><p>Yep, the diagram is missing the main power buss. It's dangling off of the
same spot where everything else that's interesting is - the
Battery Contactor (marked MA RELAY) &lt;-&gt; Starter Contactor (marked STARTER REL)
link.</p>
<p>So let's see what we have here.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Lots of unfused wires. Do you see a <em>single</em> fuse here? Nope. That's because there aren't any. All the fuses are further downstream, off of the main buss.</li>
<li>Voltage Regulator has this extra wire running to / from cockpit that isn't really necessary and could've been kept on the hot side of the firewall (terminal 4 wire)</li>
<li>Alternator field broken at <em>output</em> (F-&gt;ALT) rather than at <em>input</em> (battery -&gt; terminal 3)</li>
<li>And the best part? <strong>Always hot wire that you can't turn off</strong> between the battery and the Master Switch to turn the Master Solenoid on.</li>
</ul>
<p>That last bit bugged me. I couldn't <em>find</em> the damn thing. Even before
actually tracing it, I knew that if the Master Solenoid is switched on the &quot;hot&quot;
side, it needs to get the power from somewhere, and that only could be battery. But I didn't see <em>any</em> wires on the always hot side of the Master Solenoid.
Only when I traced it, I actually traced the physical wire to where it goes, and
then found it. It was so tucked behind the battery -&gt; Master Solenoid wire that
it was invisible:</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-05-16-fire-hazard/fh-5.jpg" title="This little !@#!S@#...." >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-05-16-fire-hazard/fh-5-thumb.jpg" title="This little !@#!S@#...." alt="This little !@#!S@#...." >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">This little !@#!S@#....</p><p>Oh; and by the way, the Master Switch is the only switch that's <em>soldered</em> in,
and w/o any good insulation around the terminals, and over-stripped wires.
So that's just waiting to short, and the magic smoke that'll be let out
behind the panel when that shorts can't be stopped (always hot wire, remember?)</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-05-16-fire-hazard/fh-3.jpg" title="Master Switch" >

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Master Switch</p></div>
<div class="section" id="the-wires">
<h2>The Wires</h2>
<p>So I kinda went backwards here; but I thought it'd be easier to see the
diagram first.</p>
<p>Let's see.</p>
<p>Most of connections are made on this very nicely marked terminal block:</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-05-16-fire-hazard/fh-4.jpg" title="The terminal block" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-05-16-fire-hazard/fh-4-thumb.jpg" title="The terminal block" alt="The terminal block" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">The terminal block</p><p>All the switched power comes out there, and every wire is marked. This
actually helped a lot in tracing. This block is on the side of the plane,
right next to the front hole's backrest.</p>
<p>You know what threw me off the most with that damned always hot wire
(I ended up tracing it <em>physically</em>)? It's how it's hooked up.</p>
<p>Yep, it is hooked up to that terminal block. To the terminal... that is
marked.. (drumroll).... &quot;Master Switch&quot;.</p>
<p>Wait.. this actually makes sense... But where's the &quot;return&quot; from the switch?</p>
<p>Ah! It's the wire that's marked.... drumroll... &quot;Fuel Gauge&quot;!</p>
<p>So really, let's look at what's going on, shall we? Zoom in the image below, it's annotated.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-05-16-fire-hazard/fh-explained.jpg" title="Untangled" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-05-16-fire-hazard/fh-explained-thumb.jpg" title="Untangled" alt="Untangled" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Untangled</p><p>So let's see. We've got this bundle of wires, a lot of which are not fused,
and one of which is always hot.</p>
<p>The Main Buss wire is the thickest one (10 gauge maybe?) that's not fused
between this buss bar and the source (engine compartment).</p>
<p>Oh, did I mention that this buss bar is on the side of the plane near the
rear instrument panel (so that 10 gauge run, and the rest of the harness
between firewall and the panel is about 30 inches long)?</p>
<p>What else do we see there? Oh! The two little 1/16inch thick aluminum lines
carrying.. fuel pressure (and oil pressure).</p>
<p>Shall I say more?</p>
<p>Shall I say that there's a fuel tank in between the front hole (passenger) and
the firewall?</p>
<p>That the wires run along between firewall and rear cockpit along that fuel
pressure line (to fuel pressure gauge)?</p>
<p>That if one shorts to this very nearby fuel pressure line, it'll burn a hole
straight thru it, and then ignite the gas that'll start coming out?</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>Can I fix all of that?</p>
<p>Sure. But rewiring will be much much easier, because I have to touch pretty much
everything. Re-running half of individual wires in a bundle is much harder than
re-running them all.</p>
<p>So, I made a decision to rewire the plane... Sigh. Looks like I won't be
flying for a looooong time.</p>
<p>Oh, and tell you what. Tracing wires on a biplane is dangerous. I ended up twisting my knee and pulling a muscle while trying to get behind the panel so badly that I couldn't walk (or sit) for 2.5 days :(.</p>
