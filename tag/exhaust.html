<p>Ha!</p>
<p>Nowhere near.</p>
<p>You see, one of the things I wanted to fix prior to putting the plane back in the air was this.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Wing root fairing</p><p>You're looking at the bottom right wing root fairing, all oily and burnt up, with paint flaking.
It is bad. Really bad.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because it is bathed in the exhaust, and because Glenn added the smoke system on top of that.</p>
<p>Here's the best couple  pictures I have to illustrate what's going on.</p>

You can see how in the slipstream this will hit the wing root and the side, which is very much evidenced by the stains,
oil streaks, and, well, burnt up paint on the fairing.</p>
<p>I wanted to fix this very, very, very much.</p>
<div class="section" id="research">
<h2>Research</h2>
<p>As much as I am absolutely <em>not</em> afraid of electrical systems, I am very afraid of exhaust systems (and a few other things).
I just don't know enough or have enough experience.</p>
<p>What turned up to be even worse was trying to find someone who <em>does</em> know what they're talking about. I poked around, and couldn't find
anyone around or in our Chapter that knows this stuff well to be able to tell me &quot;do this, and I got a TIG machine in the corner
to weld up whatever you need&quot;.</p>
<p>So, I did the second best thing I could.</p>
<p>A couple years back, I met a gentleman at Oshkosh at our Biplane Forum gathering, Mr. T., who wrote a series of articles on motors,
including exhaust.</p>
<p>He agreed graciously to listen to me (well, &quot;read&quot;, technically) rant, and maybe guide me a bit.</p>
<p>So, to the drawing board!</p>
<p>I had to put the system back on, and hang the cowling back on the airplane as well, so that I could check everything in place.</p>
<p>When I took the exhaust system off, I plugged the stubs coming off of cylinders with duct tape. Big mistake!</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2020-02-17-exhaust/e-4.jpg" title="Duct tape on the stubs" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2020-02-17-exhaust/e-4-thumb.jpg" title="Duct tape on the stubs" alt="Duct tape on the stubs" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Duct tape on the stubs</p><p>Cleaning that crap off took GoofOff and about an hour.</p>

   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2020-02-17-exhaust/e-6-thumb.jpg" title="Old tailpipe" alt="Old tailpipe" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Old tailpipe</p><p>That's the head on picture of the old stub.</p>
<p>The first and the easiest possibility was, what would happen if I just extended it straight out?</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2020-02-17-exhaust/e-8.jpg" title="Straight extension - head on" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2020-02-17-exhaust/e-8-thumb.jpg" title="Straight extension - head on" alt="Straight extension - head on" >

   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2020-02-17-exhaust/e-7-thumb.jpg" title="Straight extension - side view" alt="Straight extension - side view" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Straight extension - side view</p><p>I used a piece of paper to mock that up. Mind you, that'd be about a 10&quot; extension! Lots of pipe, considering that the original tailpipe
was maybe 16 inches long total.</p>
<p>It was obvious that doing this would move the exhaust outboard way more than moving it down. Why is this bad? Well, the bulk of it was
hitting the aluminum side of the fuse and the plastic (okay, okay, fiberglass :) ) root fairing. Moved out this way, it would be
hitting the fabric-covered leading edge. Somehow, that didn't sit well with me, and Mr. T. concurred.</p>
<p>So, I went on a scavenging run, and borrowed a nice piece of exhaust grade 3&quot; SCAT from Mr. Dick G., my friendly neighbor, and attempted
to mock something up with that.</p>
<p>Now <em>that</em> went way better!</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2020-02-17-exhaust/e-9.jpg" title="Approx 45 degrees" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2020-02-17-exhaust/e-9-thumb.jpg" title="Approx 45 degrees" alt="Approx 45 degrees" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Approx 45 degrees</p><p>That moved the exhaust point downward, and I realized that I could play with it even more by bringing it closer to the airbox via
cutting progressively more off of the old tailpipe (at this point with SCAT I haven't yet cut anything, because I was just playing
and wasn't committed).</p>
<p>That seemed like a way to go. So, next step was to mock this up with a real 45 degree bend.</p>
<p>I got the cheapest slip-on 45 degree mandrel bend from Summit.</p>
<p>At this point, I had to commit, because using this slip-on would require some cutting.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2020-02-17-exhaust/e-10.jpg" title="Some cutting" >

 </a> <p class="small text-center">And some more cutting</p><p>And then, the fit with the bottom cowl on.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Side view</p><p>That looked just perfect! A total of about 8 inches of tube added overall, and the exhaust actually moved inboard, and way down into
the slip stream.</p>
<p>All that was left to do was to buy the actual 45 degree bend I'd be using, and find a welder.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="unobtanium">
<h2>Unobtanium</h2>
<p>I was looking around for welder who'd be willing and able while playing with the geometry. Asking around the airport didn't yield much.</p>
<p>Backup plan was Seth from <a class="reference external" href="https://marioshopllc.com/">Marioshop</a> - the guy I take my cars to (his boss is a dragster, and Seth welded a lot of tube and exhaust -
although, automotive, much thicker kind, with MIG).</p>
<p>I contacted folks from another EAA Chapter, the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.eaa59.org/">Waco 59</a>, a great and dynamic EAA Chapter which I am also
a member of, and scored - their very experienced Tech Counselor and metalworker Mike M. agreed to help me with the project. He welded
himself, and also knew a gentleman that was &quot;very artistic with his welds&quot;, as he put it.</p>
<p>I just had to get the material, jig it up to position it, and come over to weld everything up.</p>
<p>My tailpipe was 3 inches in diameter (jumping a bit ahead of myself, unusual for a motor of my size - too big). I measured .049 with
my dial calipers, which translated into 18GA, and ordered the nicest shiny new bend from Summit. When it came, I realized...</p>
<p>It was the wrong thing.</p>
<p>Way thicker than what I had.</p>
<p>I think I mis-measured. Maybe I was asleep when I did it, maybe there was a lot of crud on the old pipe and I didn't pay attention,
maybe .. but I needed 0.035 material. 20 gauge.</p>
<p>Quick Internet search - nothing.</p>
<p>More Internet searching - nothing.</p>
<p>I could buy all kinds of bends in smaller diameter tubing with 0.035 wall thickness. I could buy 3&quot; tubing with 0.049 wall. I could <em>not</em> find
3&quot; 45 degree bend in 0.035.</p>
<p>One company offered to sell me a straight piece. That was a good backup - we could've mitered and welded up the 45 degree bend in
sections, but I wanted to see if I could find a bend. That same company offered to make me one - at a low price of about 600 bucks.
Yikes!</p>
<p>Attempting to Hail Mary again, I <a class="reference external" href="https://www.biplaneforum.com/threads/sources-for-large-diameter-ss-exhaust-tubing-bends.19296/#post-228307">posted on the Biplane Forum</a>. Guys came back with a bunch of phone ##s of their contacts, and I started calling around!</p>
<p>Nope, nope, nope. I don't remember who it was, but one of the guys I called suggested contacting
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.customaircraft.com/">Custom Aircraft Parts</a>.</p>
<p>A nice lady answered. &quot;You gotta talk to Clint&quot;, she said, and transferred me.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="clint">
<h2>Clint</h2>
<p>Clint picked up. I asked if they could sell me the  bend. Clint asked, &quot;What are you trying to do&quot;?</p>
<p>I explained.</p>
<p>He asked for pictures. A bit weirded out, I sent them over.</p>
<p>&quot;I have two things I wanna tell you&quot;, said Clint.</p>
<p>&quot;Buy yourself a bottle of soap and a nice rag&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;Be careful what you wish for&quot;.</p>
<p>Clit knew this 4-into-1 setup with a muffler in between very well. He told me  that even with me trying to keep the extension
as short as possible, I was running a risk of it cracking off at the muffler. Would it for sure? He didn't know. But the risk was
increasing a lot.</p>
<p>I called my old friend and a Grumman aficionado Ben the same night. Grummans have this style mufflers (mine didn't by the way
because it was sporting Powerflow - a very different system).</p>
<p>&quot;Hey, do you recall welding cracked off tailpipes?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;For sure&quot;.</p>
<p>Damn! Damn damn damn.</p>
<p>More mulling over ensued. I did <em>not</em> want to risk a tail pipe cracked off at the muffler. No way. That puts hot exhaust into a very
tight cowling. On a biplane. With my having elevated fear of any in flight fire. Remember, I embarked on the electrical
rebuild because I judged this airplane to be a <a class="reference external" href="http://79ft.net/entries/2019-05-16-fire-hazard/">flying fire hazard</a>.</p>
<p>I talked with Ben more. I talked with Mike from Waco 59 more.</p>
<p>The attempted fix solidified.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2020-02-17-exhaust/e-14.jpg" title="Exhaust hanger" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2020-02-17-exhaust/e-14-thumb.jpg" title="Exhaust hanger" alt="Exhaust hanger" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Exhaust hanger</p><p>I would put a ball joint somewhere close to the muffler, with one end on the old pipe, and one end on the new extension that includes
the bend. That ball would isolate the extension from the existing system, and allow them to move relative to one another.</p>
<p>I would then hang the new extension to the oil sump on some kind of hanger with a clamp - likely, a kind of tube with ends flattened
and bent as required.</p>
<p>I sent this schematic to Clint. Well, no, not this one. This is a nice one I did when writing this post, over a picture I took
when mocking up this solution. The one I sent to Clint was this. But, same idea.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2020-02-17-exhaust/clint.jpg" title="Schematic I sent to Clint" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2020-02-17-exhaust/clint-thumb.jpg" title="Schematic I sent to Clint" alt="Schematic I sent to Clint" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Schematic I sent to Clint</p><p>Clint's response? Verbatim:</p>
<p><em>Adding a ball joint and brace solves all of my concerns, you are free to do anything you want to the tailpipe. If you weld the bend on as your latest drawing shows, looks more reasonable. When adding a support brace it is imperative that it stabilizes the tailpipe to the engine, they must move together.</em></p>
<p>WOOT! Did I find a way to do what I wanted?</p>
<p>One thing to absolutely ensure was that the ball joint would fit.</p>
<p>We went back and forth a bit, me asking about dimensions. Then, I threw together a quick drawing of the widest part of the ball
joint - the clamp holding it together - and tried it next time I was in the hangar.</p>
<p>No way. No way it hell it would fit. Airbox would get in the way.</p>
<p>Here's probably the best picture I have of why.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2020-02-17-exhaust/mike.jpg" title="Clearances" >

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Clearances</p><p>That little triangle of &quot;air&quot; in between the cowling (bottom), exhaust pipe, and airbox is probably 1 inch on sides. No way a ball
would fit in there. No freaking way.</p>
<p>So, what am I left with?</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="putting-it-back-together-the-way-it-was">
<h2>Putting it Back Together, the Way It Was</h2>
<p>I gave up.</p>
<p>Called Clint on the way back from the airport, and asked him to sell me a straight length of pipe with a slip fit on one end.</p>
<p>Got it a week later.</p>
<p>Called Mike, got a contact for his welder, and went there.</p>
<p>The gentleman didn't like the fit - too loose - and wanted to make sure I pinned it exactly where I wanted (and actually,
I should've done that in the first place, because the opening in the cowling is very tight, and just a degree of being off would
make it interfere with the cowling). He also wanted me to clean all the gunk off.</p>
<p>So, back to the hangar, and fun fun fun with a die grinder, deburring wheel, wire brush... This 40 year old exhaust is gunky!!!</p>

<p>Mike's welder fell thru, and that cost me a couple weeks at least. I focused on some other work - panels, compass, etc.</p>
<p>One of those days, I was on the phone with D. when a gentleman I didn't recognise walked over from the hangar next door housing a PT-19,
and asked to borrow a hex key.  When I hung up, I walked over to introduce myself.</p>
<p>&quot;Hi, I'm M.&quot;</p>
<p>M.?! <strong>The</strong> M.?</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>He's somewhat of a local celebrity, having built a ton of airplanes, and having worked on more. I met him on a couple occasions in
passing, but not really, and I didn't remember his face when he walked over. He's a sheet metal and generally a metal
guy. He was working on the PT-19's electrical (ha, fun coincidence, eh?)</p>
<p>A lot of hangar flying ensued.</p>
<p>He looked over the biplane. He told me of his building a replica <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hughes_H-1_Racer">Hughes H-1</a>.
Of <em>his own design</em> basically.</p>
<p>When parting ways, I asked, &quot;Hey, do you have a welder by any chance?&quot; Asking doesn't hurt right?
&quot;Yep, I got a TIG machine&quot;.</p>
<p>Ha! Of course :) I meant to ask if he <em>knew</em> a welder. But he <em>was</em> one. I should've thought of that myself.</p>
<p>He agreed to help me weld the damn thing back on, of course. He asked for me to clean the insides. It kinda made sense, too - you want
full penetration when welding, and you don't want all that crud on the inside of the tube to &quot;float up&quot;.</p>
<p>So, lots more of a die grinder time, with flapwheels, with a compressor barely large enough to run the damn thing for a minute straight.</p>
<p>Then, drove to M's shop, drooled over the H-1 and the MP-14 that he had on it.</p>
<p>And then, the final fit of the tailpipe to put it where it was when I cut it off.</p>
<p>We put the exhaust back on the plane,..</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Rubber band maybe?</p><p>Rubber bands actually worked quite well. The kind I had was too tight, and I was playing with it trying to make it work and considering
