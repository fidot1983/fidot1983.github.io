<hr class="dashed"/><p>Well, we're continuing happily with wiring over here :).</p>
<div class="section" id="wingtips">
<h2>Wingtips</h2>
<p>SkyBeacon and SkySensor were to replace the existing nav lights. Yes, I know, SkySensor is probably a gimmick. But what the hell.</p>
<p>Remo ran nav light wires in a -4 tubing along the front wing spar, using it as kind of a &quot;conduit&quot;, exiting the wires around the wingtip,
and just soldering them to the nav lights he used. Wires were ~3 ft too long, which is a fine &quot;service whip&quot;, but they were just laying on top of the
inside of the fabric of the wingtip. There are no access holes on the wingtip, so no way to get in to tie them up.</p>
<p>Oh well. We work with what we have.</p>
<p>I was going to shorten the wires, and because the lights are on the top wing, I didn't want to solder them - I'd be doing it off of a
ladder, very near if not <em>on</em> the wing's fabric... lots of things to go wrong.</p>
<p>The other thing I didn't want to happen was to have the connection points between the light's wire pigtails and wires in the wings to &quot;rattle
around&quot; the wingtip (with no way of tying them down).</p>
<p>So I had this brilliant idea. The pic is post-realizing the idea was a mistake, with HST cut off....</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2020-09-06-wiring-2/w-1.jpg" title="SkySensor, and cut off HST" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2020-09-06-wiring-2/w-1-thumb.jpg" title="SkySensor, and cut off HST" alt="SkySensor, and cut off HST" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">SkySensor, and cut off HST</p><p>The lights had this plastic tube coming out thru which the wires were routed. I would shorten the pigtails as much as I could (like on the picture
basically), hook'em up to the wing wires with barrel crimps, and put a long piece of my favorite glue-lined SCL tubing over them - with
it glueing itself to the plastic tube and to the wires, creating one rigid &quot;tube&quot; coming off of the light...</p>
<p>Boy was that a mistake.</p>
<p>The tubing glued itself to the wires alright - but not to the plastic tube. So the whole thing created a rattly &quot;lever&quot; that would pull the
wires thru that tube when vibrated - loading the soldered joints on the PCB of the SkySensor.</p>
<p>Not Good At All.</p>
<p>So that idea had to go to trash, and I had to cut the heatshrink off, carefully, with all the glue, without damaging the wires...</p>
<p>And ended up having to do exactly what I was trying to avoid - having rattling connections between the wing wires and the
light, and to solder them. Why solder? Well, because the barrel crimps are heavy, relatively speaking, and I didn't want those heavy &quot;bumps&quot;
bouncing around inside the wingtip, even with HST around them.</p>
<p>So, solder.</p>
<p>From the ladder, on top of the wing, covered in fabric.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Let there be light!</p><p>The other fun part? On the left side, Remo had standard 6-32 tapped holes in whatever the backing of the light socket for the navlight was
made out of. I couldn't really see - maybe a nutplate, maybe just tapped sheet metal.</p>
<p>But on the right side, he used sheet metal screws. Which, of course, I didn't know about till I started putting the lights on - because I
took apart the left side when checking if SkyBeacon will fit, and assumed the other side would be exactly the same. As usual, rookie mistake.
By now, I should know to check everything.</p>
<p>Well, that was a minor delay. Spruce / AN standard doesn't have screws with the right size head (#6 AN screws have heads too large to
fit on the SkyBeacon and SkySensor), so McMaster-Carr had to be resorted to to get the right size and length sheet metal screws.</p>

<div class="section" id="p-leads">
<h2>P-Leads</h2>
<p>The Charger has the Bendix mags, and the P-lead connectors on those are not ring-terminated; instead, using a &quot;screw in&quot; type deal.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2020-09-06-wiring-2/w-2.jpg" title="Bendix type p-lead connector - old wire" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2020-09-06-wiring-2/w-2-thumb.jpg" title="Bendix type p-lead connector - old wire" alt="Bendix type p-lead connector - old wire" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Bendix type p-lead connector - old wire</p><p>Basically, the shielded wire goes thru the outer bushing. The ferrule is a &quot;T&quot;-shaped sleeve, and shield get spread out over the &quot;shank&quot; of the
T. It's squished between the outer bushing's base and the &quot;flat&quot; of the T of the inner ferrule.</p>
<p>The center wire goes thru an insulating spacer (that brown piece), and thru a washer on the other end - with a &quot;button&quot; of solder built on
top of the washer to create a contact point.</p>
<p>The whole contraption gets screwed into the mag's receiving hole with the nut - ferrule rests against the mag's casing, pushing on the insulator
and the solder button to contact the contact point inside the mag, while the nut pushes on the outer bushing and clamps the shield between
it's base and the inner ferrule.</p>
<p>Now, that works with something like 16GA wire, and it's too big with my small 20GA P-leads. Also, notice how beat up the shield on that
setup is? That's the old P-lead.</p>
<p>Folks make adapters for these to go to ring terminals, but they run something like $100 per, which is just silly, so I was determined to
make this work.</p>
<p>Here was my idea, and what it looked like on the right mag. Note <em>two</em> P-lead wires - one of them goes to the front cockpit's tach.</p>
<p>We pigtail the shield.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">First layer of heatshrink, thru the ferrule</p><p>Then, the second layer of heatshrink goes over the ferrule, &quot;sandwiching&quot; it between the two layers of HST.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Second layer of heatshrink</p><p>And with that, the bushing would slide over the outer heatshrink... but wait. Not so fast! The hole in the bushing's too small, maybe just
by .010 too small, to fit over that layer.</p>
<p>Damn.</p>
<p>After playing with various heatshrinks for the outer layer, and trying to slide the bushing on while the HST was hot, I gave up, and...</p>
<p>... just enlarged the hole in the bushing. Yes, I know. The bushing seems to be CAD plated, and I surely took it off (the bushing was magnetic). We'll see how it fares -
if I see rust, I can always buy the adapters for silly prices.</p>

<h2>FWF, finishing up</h2>
<p>And then, the rest of FWF. The only other interesting tidbit was my thinking about the Starter Warning light wire. It's one that goes off of
the &quot;I&quot; terminal of the starter contactor - which goes &quot;hot&quot; when the starter contactor closes - to indicate &quot;starter engaged&quot; with
a light. The whole shebang is probably superficial, but I convinced myself that I wanted it if for nothing else than to maintain &quot;symmetry&quot;
of lights on my panel.</p>
<p>Silly.</p>
<p>Anyway, that wire needed a fuse - though it's an intermittent wire, and I'll admit to thinking about maybe not having a fuse on it,
decided to do it, because it wouldn't harm a thing.</p>
<p>Used a 1A &quot;legged&quot; type PCB mount fuse there.</p>

<hr class="dashed"/><p>Well, damn. With almost a year (no, more than a year!) of my being a caretaker of the Chickenhouse Charger, I
finally was about to actually begin what I have started - which was, putting in <em>my</em> wires.</p>
<p>I decided to start at the switches, and run from the panel forward. Some wires will terminate at the fuse blocks
(power feeds), and some will go forward - to the front panel, voltage regulator, and firewall forward.</p>
<p>Then, I was planning to run a few wires backwards - the ones that were pre-terminated on my transducers (fuel,
oil pressures, oil temp, and mag pickup for the tach).</p>
<p>Immediately, I will admit: <strong>that was a mistake</strong>. While the harness turned out alright, it could've been
much neater - if I ran in one direction. I could've made sure the whole thing is wire to wire and perfectly
clean. So I should've run front to back, because my pre-terminated wires all &quot;started&quot; upfront.</p>
<p>In other words, prop to tail. Well sigh. Next time. On the other hand, this approach would've made terminating
switches at the panel a nightmare. That was, initially, the reason why I wanted to start at the panel - so that
I'd pre-attach wires to switches, tie them up, and then trim them at the other end.</p>
<p>At any rate.... Shall we?</p>
<div class="section" id="prep">
<h2>Prep</h2>
<p>Couple things to knock off before I started wiring was to complete the back panel. One thing that was
left was the compass correction card bracket. No problem, drilled and tapped a couple holes for #2 brass screws.</p>
<p>Here's Mr. M. installing it:</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Compass Correction Card Bracket</p><p>The other one was the inertia switch for the smoke system. Glenn had it in for &quot;safety&quot;: in the event of a
shock (crash?) the switch breaks the circuit. I am.. not sure why he would have it, but he had it.</p>
<p>I considered not putting it back in, but what the hell.</p>
<p>Here's the switch:</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Shock switch</p><p>The problem was, it sat tightly between other switches in the panel. With old layout, that barely worked; but with
the new layout, and Honeywell double throw switches, the connector plug was getting in the way. So I had to resort
to some vandalism. :)</p>

<h2>Panel</h2>
<p>Now ready, I decided to install the switches first, and then wire them from the back. I needed a couple short jumpers
though to connect them, and to set up some wires to be the exact length. That'd be impossible with switches
installed in the panel (too little access), so I set up an old placard plate, installed switches into it,
and worked on those jumpers and terminations on the bench before moving them to the airplane.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Engine starter engaged position - note that I can hit the starter and hold the throttle with the same hand</p><p>...when it dawned on me...</p>
<p>My three most important switches, L and R Mags, and Master, were set up with lockouts - you couldn't turn them on
just by clicking them, instead, having to pull the lever first to move it to the &quot;on&quot; position. I mostly
did that to protect from accidental too playful a kid in the cockpit.</p>
<p>But they weren't locked out in the &quot;on&quot; position!</p>
<p>Why is that important? Well, the Smoke and the Fuel Pump - the most <em>operated</em> switches on this plane - are
right there. Note how their levers are shorter? If I accidentally hit the longer levered Master, or a Mag, switch,
that would turn it <em>off</em> - with me potentially shutting down the motor. While a remote possibility, improving
the situation would amount to just replacing the switches to the ones with lockouts in <em>both</em> on <em>and</em> off positions.</p>
<p>I don't know how I missed that when designing the original setup...</p>
<p>I decided to do it.</p>
<p>So out came the switches, I had to un-wire the terminals from the back. In went the order for three new
switches with now correct lock-outs.</p>
<p>About a week later, I had them, and could proceed.</p>
<p>With left side wired up, I could tie it down. Mind you, access there is tight and from all kinds of
weird angles :).</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Right side</p><p>You can see the beginnings of the ground strap to bond the panel with the &quot;side conduit&quot;, holding the fuse
blocks and being one of the grounding points. In my <a class="reference external" href="https://79ft.net/entries/2019-08-11-design-v1/">original design</a>,
I had firewall, motor, &quot;side conduit&quot;, and panel, as ground points - all bonded with those straps.</p>
<p>Here's the right side:</p>

<p>I also had some fun with ADELs right where the wires turn from the &quot;side conduit&quot; towards the panel.
I had to clear and negotiate a couple bowdens, and the engine monitor harness was unwieldy.</p>
<p>I think that took a number of hours, just trying various setups, the final one that I really liked was this:</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Engine monitor and carb heat bowden.</p><p>I replaced all the ugly zipties with lacing, of course :).</p>
<p>Meanwhile, on the outside, to keep the wires nicely separated, I spread them out in kind of a &quot;fan&quot; in the order
they ran, back to front:</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Wire fan</p><p>A day later, I replaced the tape with a comb. Yep, a cheapo $1 comb :) Worked out great.</p>
<p>And finally, before committing and continuing, I checked each wire for gauge, and proper circuitry.</p>

<h2>Side Contuit, Part I</h2>
<p>With all those wires sticking out, it was now time to start figuring out routing in the side conduit. All the wires
that had to go forward had, well, to go forward.</p>
<p>After lots of fiddling, I ended up with this:</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Initial stab at the side conduit routing</p><p>I had to clear all the brackets, and other sharp things. Ended up adding a couple more ADELs (and drilling holes

</div>
<div class="section" id="front-panel">
<h2>Front Panel</h2>
<p>The most interesting piece in it was a Westach tach, that fed directly off of a P-Lead and required a .25A
fuse. Glenn used a 1A classic glass fuse, but I decided to do it right. See, the thing is, if it fails &quot;short
circuit&quot;, that'd turn off the mag - I guess that's why the fuse is in there.</p>
<p>The tach would get another 20GA shielded wire, just like a p-lead, and I decided to join it to right mag's
p-lead at the magneto - instead of splicing it into the p-lead running front to back in the side conduit.</p>
<p>But, back to the fuse. I figured, I'd build it into my connector that hooks up to the tach. Then, if blown,
the connector could be rebuilt. Yep, it's more annoying than a regular replaceable fuse, but that circuit is
not critical, and I had no room for a &quot;regular&quot; fuse block or holder.</p>
<p>So I got me a &quot;legged&quot; .25A fuse with a massive voltage rating (I forget what it was, but definitely above
what a mag makes), and hooked it to a regular Molex pin.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">On the tach</p><p>The lead is just a regular pigtailed P-lead, of course. Notice how I like using SCL around individual Molex pins
for added strain relief - that's because I can't produce good Molex crimps that I like; and I end up post-soldering
them in addition to crimping. That strain relief ensures that soldered joint is firmly held immobile. Takes a bit
of extra time, but I actually like that better than straight Molex crimps.</p>
<p>The rest of the front panel wasn't interesting, just annoying. There's only three circuits there: nav lights wires
from the left wing run along the back of the panel to the right side where the conduit is, and then there's hobbs
and tach, and that's it. It was just very annoying: with very little access, not being able to see things,
and, being in the front hole, having to climb out and in every time I needed a tool I forgot to put close (when
in the back hole, I can roll up a cart to it and have all my tools there).</p>
<p>Mirror was absolutely required.</p>

<h2>Firewall Forward</h2>
<p>The final set of wires to join the main harness were all the wires coming from the firewall side - mainly,
transducers and other instrumentation wires, but also a couple wires for the voltage regulator.</p>
<p>This was precisely when I realized the mistake I talked about in the beginning - and ended up with less
neat, and more tortured harness. Oh well.</p>
<p>I started up front, trimming and terminating my fat wires for the starter and alternator B-feed. Some more extreme
soldering (to cap them), this time with a torch.</p>

<h2>Tail Light</h2>
<p>I got rid of the belly strobe on the plane, because it was too heavy and too.. useless. Wingtip lights are gonna be the SkyBeacon
and SkySensor from uAvionix (my ADSB mandate compliance :) ), and they have strobes: but they're not visible from the back. So
I decided to replace the tail nav light with an LED nav/strobe.</p>
<p>Problem number one: no ground wire going to the tail light. For whatever reason, Remo decided to basically use the fact that the
tail light is hooked up to the rudder with a pair of screws thru sheet metal of the rear rudder bow... I don't even want to begin to think what
the ground path would be: hinges? control cables?</p>
<p>So, I needed a second wire.</p>
<p>Problem number two: it had to be one neat cable, and it had to be of a smallish diameter (Remo had an old 20GA wire, which is thicker
than modern 20GA tefzel wire).</p>
<p>I decided to use a chunk of  20GA shielded - same ones I used for p-leads. Technically I guess you're not supposed to do that, but it's
very far from all the antennas and I'm crossing my fingers that it won't create too much problems. Thickness was spot on.</p>
<p>So, I soldered the new piece to the old wire, and fished it thru using old wire as a pull. That part was scary - if that didn't
work, I would've had to cut holes in the rudder to get a new wire thru.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">All hooked up!</p><p>On the other end (on the tail fin side) the wire went into a hole on the inspection cover, and had to join the wire coming from the front.
And I had to have the ground there. You can see that area right behind the elevator on the &quot;fishing wire thru&quot; picture.</p>
<p>Problem number three: <em>nothing</em> to hook up the ground to in that area. The only option I figured out  was to use one of the rivnuts that are
attached to the tabs welded to the frame, hoping that there's no corrosion there between the aluminum rivnut and steel fuselage. I figured I'd
use a way too long a screw thru one of the rivnuts when attaching that inspection cover, and then pull the ring terminal onto it, and secure it
against the back side of the rivnut with a nut and a washer. Ugly? Yes; but I didn't have any more options. Really, the right way to do that
would be to run two wires from the pilot panel all the way back, but.. I'd have to start cutting fabric for that.</p>
<p>So, I attached the positive to the wire that was already there, terminated my ground, hooked everything up, hooked up some power, and...</p>
<p>Nothing.</p>
<p>A bit of debugging showed that... ground was the problem. Damn! I picked the wrong rivnut, I guess - it had corrosion.
The one right on the other side though showed the right voltage when measured against the positive lead, so I just moved everything to the
other side, and...</p>

<p>First, conduit, cockpit side. Lots of crossing things, lots of padding for bowdens where they cross the wires (I used the right
sized vinyl tubing from my local friendly Aerospace Depot, and lacing to tie it).</p>
<p>Engine monitor harness got covered in tube for quite a distance - there was no way to keep it off and not rubbing on the conduit.</p>

money on shipping small-headed #10 screws (the screws in the terminals are #8 but with small &quot;oval&quot; rather than &quot;pan&quot; aviation style head,
so I'd have to get me some decent screws from McMaster.. by the time I'd be done, it'd be close to those $35).</p>

<hr class="dashed"/><p>A while back, I wrote a
<a class="reference external" href="https://79ft.net/entries/2019-09-07-hf-crimper/">note on my failures at getting good crimps with the hydraulic crimper I had</a>.</p>
<p>My conclusion then was, &quot;solder&quot;.</p>
<p>Well, I tried :). I had to make a little bonding strap, maybe 5 inches long.</p>
<p>First time, I cowboyed it - just stuck the strap into the terminal, and soldered away.</p>
<p>In. My. Face.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">One of the better ones</p><p>I eventually started using the &quot;wedge&quot; trick - to wedge a piece of thick wire in between

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Back side</p><p>My main problem was, I was trying to prevent solder wicking as much as I could. And I couldn't.
It would make 1 inch or more of the wire perceivably &quot;crusty&quot;, and I still won't have the barrel
filled in. Remember, I was trying to make a small, short grounding strap, that had to be flexible
to bend almost 180 degrees. I was trying to achieve a &quot;crimp quality&quot; break between solid metal
and strands, and could not.</p>
<p>When I started thinking about it like that, I realized that what I'm trying to do is likely impossible.</p>
<p>Solder will wick - you can control how much with technique and practice, but you can't prevent it.
So my current thinking is, if you solder your large lugs, be ready to support first few inches
of wire really well, so that that &quot;crusty&quot; portion of it doesn't move.</p>
<p>So, I tried to Hail Mary the crimps again. Previously, I had them just damn ugly (I linked the
article above).</p>
<p>I got a small anvil tool (the kind you insert the barrel of the terminal and whack a pin with a
hammer) from Spruce. Thought, 25 bucks was worth a try.</p>
<p>Those crimps were even uglier. I don't know what I expected - I guess that was an act of desperation?
I didn't even take a single picture.</p>
<p>But then... I had a minor epiphany.</p>
<p>With the Harbor Freight Crimper, dies are not properly ground for wire sizes. But. But.</p>
<p>Just like with hammering, we can crimp progressively until we &quot;flow&quot; all the strands and the barrel
into one solid piece!</p>
<p>Here's the approach (okay, this is the <em>final</em> procedure, first try did not include turning - but I
did it (admittedly, accidentally), and liked the results a lot).</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Given wire gauge of, say, 6</li>
<li>Use die 2 sizes up - so, die marked for #2 wire</li>
<li>Put the wire in the terminal. Start by squeezing the terminal turned 90 degrees (so &quot;side to side&quot; rather then &quot;top to bottom&quot;). Just give it a gentle oval shape</li>
<li>Now, turn it 90 degrees and squeeze until the jaws close</li>
<li>At this point, you will have a somewhat <em>undercrimped</em> joint, as I described in my notes on the crimper; but it's shape will be a perfect hex.</li>
<li>Now, go 1 size &quot;down&quot; (so, dies marked for #4 wire). Squeeze.</li>
<li>Stop when you feel it's done shrinking.</li>
</ul>
<p>Results?</p>

go somewhere else, too.</p>

<div class="section" id="wire-marking">
<h2>Wire Marking</h2>
<p>I like marked wires. I used to be a networking guy, and I was very meticulous about marking every single wire in my cabinets, so that I knew
exactly what was plugged in where.</p>
<p>It took a bit of upfront time, but saved a bunch of it later on.</p>
<p>So naturally, I was planning to do the same on the Charger, and, more importantly, make it look <em>professional</em>.</p>
<p>Thanks to living in this day and age, that is simple. No, I'm not gonna pay someone to laser etch my wires - that's a cop out :). It's like
paying someone to paint your plane.</p>
<p>Instead, I have researched and found a perfect label maker - Brady BMP21 (not including a link here because it will probably go dead after
some time... just search for it). This thing has 3:1 heatshrink tube cartridges.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Shrunk!</p></div>
<div class="section" id="fusible-links">
<h2>Fusible Links</h2>
<p>Every wire must be fused at the source. Well, almost every :). We don't fuse a couple wires like battery - master contactor: but this is
an exception rather than the rule.</p>
<p>Most wires are fused on the fuse block at the main buss. But some wires are impractical or impossible to have hooked up to that. Think ammeter
shunt wires as a classic example.</p>
<p>For those, most people use bulky, ugly, and generally eww-y inline fuses. But there's a better option! Enter fusible links.</p>
<p>The idea is simple: use a short length of wire 4 gauges smaller the wire to be fused. So if your wire to be fused is 20AWG, you would do:</p>
<p>Source -&gt; 24AWG -&gt; 20AWG where the 24AWG segment acts as a fuse. The idea is, in case of a short, that piece will burn first.</p>
<p>So, I wanted to convince myself that that will work fine for me.</p>
<p>Initially, me and my ham neighbor tried to use his ~30 amp power supply to do it. No joy. The best we could do is 22 amps, and (imagine that!) 24
gauge we were trying to burn held up to the abuse with no sweat at all! I could even hold it in my fingers. Yay, milspec wire!</p>
<p>So I decided to go rough. I do have a discarded old  battery, after all. It was time to burn some wires with it.</p>
<p>Here, the red wire is 20AWG, and the black wire is 24AWG. Using crimps for quick setup.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Boom!</p><p>It burnt real quick, in less than a second, and the protected (red) wire barely got hot (I was holding it - that was a part of the test). Yes, say
that I am unscientific all you want - milspec wire holds up to 150C, and I can't hold up to 150C. The 20GA wire got barely warm - which means it
won't cause any problems in a bundle.</p>
<p>It worked!</p>
<p>Now, it was time to set up a real one - to make sure that when the &quot;fuse&quot; wire burns, it doesn't damage anything.</p>
<p>B&amp;C sells very nice fiberglass tubing covered in silicone for exactly this purpose.</p>
<p>I also soldered the fuselink in this time - I wanted to see how well will the solder splices hold to the temps.</p>

sleeve will go over it.</p>

<p>I took it off to inspect.</p>

hey - this worked very well indeed!</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="load-measurements">
<h2>Load Measurements</h2>
<p>Prior to ripping the old wiring out, I wanted to take some real life load measurements with various things turned on,
so that I don't get any nasty surprises.</p>
<p>But this plane has no ammeter... damn. I searched around, and found this little doodad:</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-06-18-fuselinks/hamm.jpg" title="Hall Effect ammeter" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-06-18-fuselinks/hamm-thumb.jpg" title="Hall Effect ammeter" alt="Hall Effect ammeter" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Hall Effect ammeter</p><p>Very nice. It basically measures current on the wire passing thru this big white ring using Hall effect. Very cool! No need to splice into
the battery leads and install a temp shunt.</p>
<p>So, I rigged it up and took some numbers.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-06-18-fuselinks/amm-1.jpg" title="Rigged up" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-06-18-fuselinks/amm-1-thumb.jpg" title="Rigged up" alt="Rigged up" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Rigged up</p><ul class="simple">
<li>Master On: 1.5 amps<ul>
<li>Includes: Master Solenoid, and a couple of gauges</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Fuel Pump: 0.2 amps</li>
<li>&quot;Radios&quot; switch (turns on engine monitor, and power to radios: turning backlighting on them): 0.8 amps</li>
<li>I-Com Radio, Transmit: 2.6 amps</li>
<li>Intercom: 0.1 amps</li>
<li>Transponder: 1.1 amps</li>
<li>Smoke Oil pump: 2.2 - 2.6 amps (high on startup)</li>
</ul>
<p>So couple interesting things here. I think the x-der number is too low, but it wasn't being interrogated, and I can't make it be interrogated
without flying the plane or using a transponder tester which I don't have. Also, Master On is too high seemingly...
Will need to double check later and isolate things (master solenoid, hobbs, voltmeter, voltage regulator, fuel gauge) if I care enough - I don't
think I do. Also, fuel pump is too low seemingly. Need to double-check the spec.</p>
<p>And then, I could not turn on the Turn-Slip Indicator...</p>

<div class="section" id="turn-slip-indicator">
<h2>Turn-Slip Indicator</h2>
<p>Sad, sad indicator... see, it's <em>long</em>. And it's wire connector is sticking out. And it's right behind the front seat's headrest, and there's
just not enough room for it, and the connector.</p>
<p>So whomever put it in... did this:</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Sad, sad wiring</p><p>It's hard to see; but basically, those wires are bent &quot;down&quot; at a very sharp 90 degrees angle. Notice how he just used pins without the
actual connector. The distance between them is tiny! I am surprised they haven't shorted over all these years. I really am.</p>
<p>Initially, I thought the gauge didn't turn on because that wiring was all bust up, so to test it, I decided to pull it out.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">On the bench</p><p>I cut off the wires with those pins on them to hook it up to my testing battery... hmm.. but I needed some leads! Well, I was gonna
make a bunch of various test leads - so this is as good a time as any! Man, I love soldering...</p>
<p>I long decided to make a bunch of leads with &quot;passthru&quot; banana plugs on one end, and something (a crocodile clamp, a battery clamp,
a ring terminal) on the other. This way, I could mix and match, and plug them into my multimeter; daisy chain, and have multiples
depending on what and how I needed to hook up. I had all the bits (clamps, crocodiles, banana plugs), and even got a roll of very nice super
flexible silicone coated probe wire.</p>

<p>Well, well. So that gyro &quot;froze&quot; in a bit... Yep, it was hard to turn over with a finger - no doubt a small motor in there had a hard time!</p>
<p>I probably &quot;cleared it up&quot; a bit when turning it over with my fingers - but that won't last long... damn.</p>
<p>Are we looking at the overhaul for this thing too now? Sigh.... Maybe I can find parts
to do that myself, but not so sure about that.... It's not common for owners to overhaul their instruments - they're precision clockwork, after
all...</p>
<p>Oh well.</p>
<p>And I will have to figure out how to solve that wiring problem with no space to hook up the right type connector. I am thinking along the
lines of maybe routing a wire from inside of the gauge down thru a hole I'd drill, a grommet it it, and covering the whole business with
with some sealant or something, so that the dust doesn't get in. we'll see. Need to ponder this a bit more.</p>
