<hr class="dashed"/><p>Well, since it seems now that my Hangar will become my shop for a while with me doing the
<a class="reference external" href="http://79ft.net/entries/2019-05-16-fire-hazard/">electrical rebuild</a> on the Charger,
I decided to set myself up in it. I am still rebuilding the main shop at the house (reminder: need to write up a couple notes on that),
so the only place I have to work on the plane is in the hangar - and frankly, I probably wouldn't have dragged the whole thing over
to the house anyway just for an electrical rebuild... though it is getting hot, and being in a tin can of a hangar when it's 100 degrees outside
is not.. pleasant, shall we say.</p>
<p>At any rate, the Hangar is now to be officially known as The Dream Shop, Georgetown Annex!</p>
<p>Not much to tell - but much to show here.</p>
<div class="section" id="easy-route">
<h2>Easy Route</h2>
<p>I didn't have anything in the hangar besides a couple of old bookshelves, a couple of small tables, a few filing cabinets I have inherited from my
good friend Pete, and a cart. Not very nicely set up for working on airplanes, and everything was overflowing with parts, tools,
and hardware even after just a bit of disassembly I have done for the annual.</p>
<p>I needed a lot of shelf space, and a lot of bench space.</p>
<p>I decided to take an easy route this time, and instead of building everything, just bought a bunch of shelves at Costco, and benches
and a tool cart at ... Harbor Freight. Yep, I know. Throw a rotten egg in my face next time you see me.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-06-17-hangar-redo/hr-1-2.jpg" title="The First Shelf" >

 </a> <p class="small text-center">The First Shelf</p></div>
<div class="section" id="the-light">
<h2>The Light</h2>
<p>I work evenings a lot, and the only light source there was there was a four T8 tube fixture in the back of the hangar.
But the most interesting stuff is on the front of it (engine, yep :) ). So I added some lights around the front.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-06-17-hangar-redo/hr-2.jpg" title="Lights" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-06-17-hangar-redo/hr-2-thumb.jpg" title="Lights" alt="Lights" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Lights</p></div>
<div class="section" id="the-benches">
<h2>The Benches</h2>
<p>Next, came the benches from Harbor Freight. Don't buy them. They're built like crap, and, frankly, I think I could've built better ones out of
2x4s in about the same amount of time it took me to put these together... But hey, I already bought them, and disassembling the first one
(I got three total) rather than putting the other two together... I didn't want to...</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-06-17-hangar-redo/hr-3.jpg" title="Benches" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-06-17-hangar-redo/hr-3-thumb.jpg" title="Benches" alt="Benches" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Benches</p><p>You might notice the pegboard at the back &quot;wall&quot; of those benches. Well, they attach it every about 12 inches around the perimeter with machine
screws and nuts. Guess what happened to the first pegboard after a humidity cycled high, and then low? Yep; it all warped!</p>
<p>Ended up resorting to straightening it out with shelves that acted as &quot;stiffeners&quot;,  and putting the warped pegboard bench as far
away from the &quot;main&quot; bench as possible).</p>
<p>On the other two I actually made the pegboard &quot;floating&quot; - re-drilled the mounting holes to be large, and used large washers and just enough
small washers underneath to MacGyver me a &quot;bushing&quot;. That worked, and the other two benches' pegboard is straight after quite a few large
humidity changes now.</p>
<p>And then, the sink.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-sink">
<h2>The Sink</h2>
<p>I long had a large 7 gallon jug with a tap. When I was doing a lot of work, I'd drag it out of the hangar, put it on a small folding table, and
use it to wash my hands. Very nice to be able to do that when your hands are covered in oil and crud, and you need to climb into the airplane
or grab something generally clean. I also like clean hands when doing detail work like soldering, painting, etc.</p>

   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-06-17-hangar-redo/hr-4-thumb.jpg" title="The Jug" alt="The Jug" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">The Jug</p><p>But dragging out a 7 gallon jug every time I got into the hangar got very old very fast, and I ended up typically resorting to rags and not
so clean hands, or &quot;washing&quot; them with mineral spirits... ugh.</p>
<p>But hey, we're cleaning up! So I decided to put in...</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-06-17-hangar-redo/hr-5.jpg" title="The Sink!" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-06-17-hangar-redo/hr-5-thumb.jpg" title="The Sink!" alt="The Sink!" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">The Sink!</p><p>But a sink needs a drain!</p>
<p>No problem.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-06-17-hangar-redo/hr-6.jpg" title="The Drain." >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-06-17-hangar-redo/hr-6-thumb.jpg" title="The Drain." alt="The Drain." >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">The Drain.</p><p>This came out very nice, and I love that I can now just wash my hands whenever, no jug dragging required.</p>
<p>The best part? The hangar door slides, so I can have it <em>closed</em> and then slide it a bit past it's &quot;closed&quot; position, so that there's a gap
between the hangar divider wall and the outside for the drain to be put out.</p>
<p>But how do I close the door?</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Retractable!</p><p>Do I need a Complex endorsement to operate in my hangar now? ;)</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-wiring">
<h2>The Wiring</h2>
<p><em>Before you wire your plane, wire your hangar</em>, says a proverb. Or something like that.</p>
<p>Well, my hangar floods. And it's not <em>my</em> hangar, so I can't quite make holes in the walls and run wiring and conduit. And I only have one outlet.
Yep.</p>
<p>So it was all to be a bunch of extension cords, making sure that all connections are suspended a few inches above the floor, hooked to
something (previous tenant of my hangar had some holes in the walls drilled, so I reused his, or hooked them up to legs of whatever was there, etc).</p>
<p>I ended up making a bunch of splices on extension cords. Hey, I love soldering!</p>

<div class="section" id="air-and-shelves">
<h2>Air and Shelves</h2>
<p>I had a compressor. I moved it to the back corner of the hanger, and hooked up a reel in the front, so that I can have my hoses neat...
Not much more.</p>
<p>The back wall of the hangar got lined with the big shelves, too... Mostly, to stack the parts I take off the plane and need to keep off.</p>
<p>The first one up is there on the right, near the yellow barrel.</p>

<div class="section" id="the-shrine">
<h2>The Shrine</h2>
<p>... and since the Charger is a Grand Champion, I needed a shrine in the &quot;mancave corner&quot; of the hangar. Every hangar must have a
corner with a couch, a fridge and what-not, to relax and ponder and procrastinate. And that's where all the artifacts need to go.</p>

</div>
<div class="section" id="the-bench">
<h2>The Bench</h2>
<p>I needed at least one good bench for grinders, bandsaw, and aluminum work; and there was a perfect spot for it. Didn't have my wood tools
though, so had to use 2x4s straight out of the store... Normally, I mill them down :).</p>

<hr class="dashed"/><p><a class="reference external" href="http://79ft.net/entries/pickles/">As we have established before</a>, Fall for Russians is all about pickling things.</p>
<p>Last time it was an O-360. This time, it's tools for the new shop.</p>
<p>My current shop is all packed up and in storage, waiting for the actual
shop to be built. Well, actually for the building to be gutted.</p>
<p>When I have built the new house, I have kept the old house. That's what's
about to become my Dream Shop. Meanwhile, all my tools are nicely set up
in my storage shed, waiting for their time.</p>
<p>I have sold most of my Chinese Grizzly crap I bought before knowing
any better, and was hunting good, old, American-made machines for a while.</p>
<p>Okay, I settled for a Chinese-made Powermatic drill press, arguing with
myself that it was in mint shape, dialed in with no obvious runout / shake,
and would be my wood-only press anyway.</p>
<p>But two most important things wood-wise I still didn't have: a jointer and a
table saw. Few had come up on Craigslist, and I would go over to check them out
with all my dial gauges and a U-Haul trailer in tow.</p>
<p>I would spend close to an hour with each one of them, measuring all sorts of
convoluted alignments and run-outs, only to find something very <em>basic</em> wrong
with them.</p>
<p>One of these was a newer (mustard, but still American-made) PM60 jointer. It
checked out reasonably well; until I asked the guy if I could adjust his fence
square (I wanted to check it's warp by measuring squareness to tables along
it's length).</p>
<p>&quot;Sure Thing!&quot; - he said, walked to a corner of his shop, picked up a hammer,
and ... WHACK! - ... ... yeah. Call me a WHACK-o, but that is <em>not</em> how you
adjust squareness...  Not in my book. I felt for the poor machine.</p>
<p>I left, of course.</p>
<p>Another time I spent just south of 40 minutes with a PM66 table saw, only to check
it's flatness dead last. Of course, it was so horribly bowed out of shape,
I had to leave. And <em>that</em> was a 3 hour drive. Each way, mind you!</p>
<p>At any rate, yet another PM60 jointer popped up on Craigslist, and I grabbed
a trailer in preparation of going to San Antonio the next day. That's where
the jointer was.</p>
<p>Now, there was a rolling joke with one of the guys from the office - that he
absolutely HAS to convince yet another guy from our office, his buddy, to
sell me his PM66 saw - or, Russian Mafia will get him! Them both, in fact!</p>
<p>I kept it up for over a year; and I am not sure if that joke had made any
contribution to this... but, he called me and said, &quot;Roger is selling his
Powermatic! Grab it, QUICK!&quot;. Same day as the jointer popped up.</p>
<p>Hah. So tomorrow I am about to go possibly pick up a jointer.
Did I just land me a saw too?</p>
<p>I went to Roger's to dial the saw.</p>
<p>Arbor was shot, but trunnions were in great shape, and arbor for PM-66 is not
a problem (someone still literally makes them and sells them on EBay). The
tables were flat aside from a very tiny dip, a bit dirty at that, but alright.</p>
<p>I decided to pick it up.</p>
<p>So I did land me a saw and a possible jointer!!!</p>
<p>Next day (Friday), I rush to San Antonio to look at the jointer.</p>
<p>It was a green, older one, and it checked out good, except one minor
mis-alignment of infeed and outfeed tables. I was trying to tighten them up
a touch with gib set screws, and... I broke one of them.</p>
<p>The tables were flat, the motor was good, and the price was reasonable though,
so I decided to buy it from the guy - especially after I broke it :).</p>
<p>Didn't take any pictures of jointer in transit... damn.</p>
<p>So, Friday night Im back, barely manage to roll the jointer off the trailer and into the garage, and Saturday I pack my wrenches and such to go break down the saw at Roger's.</p>
<p>See, it was set up with a large side table, router plate insert, and outfeeds
- no way I would've been able to load all that; and besides,  I don't need
any of that aside from core saw. I already have all my router stuff from
my previous shop (<a class="reference external" href="http://www.incrementaltools.com/">Incra</a> no less).</p>
<p>It's raining. Damn.</p>
<p>I get to his place - he's gone for the weekend, his wife lets me in and leaves
me alone with the saw and my tools.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Most of exterior stuff off, table's coming off next</p><p>I took off the fence, the side table, and the outfeed rollers. Side
table goes into trash. Outfeeds and the fence I will sell (in fact, as
of right now I sold the fence already - had three guys call me in the same
day!). Yeah, I don't care for it. Incra's TS-LS any day over any other fence
(and I have one :) ).</p>
<p>It was obvious no one has cleaned it inside. Likely, ever. Oh, well...</p>

<hr class="dashed"/><p>So, originally it was supposed to be the shop <em>day</em>. I was gonna clean and
put together the compressor I picked up off a gentleman on Craigslist, and set
up the air hoses, filters and such - and then, back to CAD. And then..</p>
<p>See, I was looking for a bandsaw. I wasn't in a rush, so I was
gonna pick up a good used one; so I was watching Craigslist and such,
waiting and waiting. After doing that for about 6 months and after I got
tired of not having one; I finally said &quot;screw it&quot; and bid on one on Ebay.</p>
<p>I won it on Friday around 4pm; paid, and went home. Well; there, in my
Gmail's Inbox, was a notification from
<a class="reference external" href="http://craigwatcher.com/">CraigWatcher</a> saying that yet another bandsaw
ad was posted... I opened it up; and couldn't believe my eyes.</p>
<p>Someone was selling.. an 18 inch Grizzly saw for 250 bucks! I couldn't pass
on it; and next morning was driving back with a 300 pound beast in the back
of my car....</p>
<p>... and then, spent a week and a half cleaning it up. I polished the rust out of
the table; changed some bearings, re-cut threads on the blade tensioning
rod, added a 4 inch dust port (for whatever weird reason, Grizzly decided
not to put a dust port on this particular model).</p>
<p>It also ran on the 220, so I had to add a 220 outlet to the shop... Decided to
go all out; and added a 6 gauge run with 50 amp breaker, so that I can run
a TIG welder off of it when I get one.</p>
<p>So now; I own two bandsaws :).</p>
<p>Here's the perpetrator:</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">The Bandsaw</p><p>Since we're talking shop....</p>
<p>Right now Im set up in the garage of the old house we bought about half a year
ago. Dash (my beautiful wife) is working on designing a new house we're gonna
build; and that one is going to have a good sized shop. We will build
that house first and then demo the old house; so I could start setting
up earlier than I thought I would be able to; which is certainly nice.</p>
<p>But; Im dealing with 40 year old electrical; and other fun stuff..</p>
<p>Here are some pictures of that garage, ordered historically, as I was setting
up.</p>

<p>Air setup is very simple, a compressor with a shutoff directly into an air
filter, regulator, and 25 feet of hose on a reel. That reaches pretty much
everywhere.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/shop-june-2014/air.jpg" title="The Air Setup (very simple for now)" >

 </a> <p class="small text-center">The Air Setup (very simple for now)</p><p>At some point; I measured the runout on the drill press -- got around 10
thousandths - no wonder why it was all vibrating when drilling deep holes!</p>
<p>Grizzly includes very cheap chucks and arbors with their presses... Gladly,
the bearings have no play though. I ended up picking up a used Jacobs chuck
on Ebay, and boy, what a world of difference! Used a SouthBend arbor picked
up on Amazon.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/shop-june-2014/chuck.jpg" title="The Jacobs Chuck" >

 </a> <p class="small text-center">The Jacobs Chuck</p><p>I wanted a router table; but didn't want to pay around a grand for the one
I like (and cheap ones are just.. crap, honestly); so I built one.</p>
<p>Top is two sheets of 3/4 MDF, laminated together.  White Formica is laminated on
top, bottom, and sides. All done with DAP Weldwood contact cement.</p>
<p>I bought the insert plate (though in hindsight, I should've just bought
a hunk of aluminum and made it myself).</p>
<p>It still ended up being a bit out-of-flat, so I built a leveling system into
the base (two bolts on each side are pulling the top &quot;down&quot;, screwing into holes
in the top with threaded inserts; and there are two screws pushing up on the top
in the center of each long frame side. All that allows me to work out any
non-flatness out of the top.</p>
<p>Fence is 3/4 ply; and the router sits in the box under the table. The box
has 4 inch dust fitting epoxied on it on the other side (and the fence
dust collector feeds into that fitting too).</p>
