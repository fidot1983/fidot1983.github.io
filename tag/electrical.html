<hr class="dashed"/><p>... and the only bit of wiring left was the gauges at the panel.</p>
<p>It was not interesting in any way - mostly, lots of tying in awkward position.</p>
<p>A lot of stuff had to be done thru the front hole's headrest, while standing on a wing, and trying not to get &quot;tangled&quot; in the
flying and landing wires.</p>
<p>Oh well.</p>
<p>I realized this was another mistake. Since all the gauge wires started at their transducers or sensors (amps, fuel and oil pressures,
oil temp, and the like), I ran them &quot;backwards&quot; as one piece, and was planning to put on the corresponding D-Sub connectors
in place.</p>
<p>What I didn't realize was how much pain it will be if I had to work in close quarters. And unfortunately, the 3-in-1 gauge - with the
fattest of the connectors - required that.</p>
<p>What I should've done was cut the transducer and sensor's wires and made &quot;whips&quot; for them with connectors while on the bench.  Then, I
should've spliced them somewhere on the side of the airplane - yes, I'd have to do a lot of soldering, but that would've been better
than what I ended up having to do...</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Instrument wires - and the back side of 3-in-1</p><p>You can see the DB-15 connector there - that's the 3-in-1. Sticking the wires thru the instrument hole, doing all the stripping and crimping
from the panel side while sitting in the cockpit, and then tying the extra length up... maybe was possible, but seemed to me like it would
be too much extra, producing ugliness and possibly rubbing on the structure nearby, so I decided to make that connector as close to the
actual gauge as I could...</p>
<p>I tried it on the bench first, figuring out where I would put heatshrink, how much of the length is necessary for the connector, and the like.</p>
<p>Another interesting tidbit was that one of the connections had to feed two transducers off of the same one pin. Both wires were 22GA
and I couldn't put them into the pin no matter how I tried - too much wire for one D-SUB pin's barrel. I'll show you the solution I used for that.</p>
<p>So, I bunched up the wires, put a round of heatshrink on, and prepped those power wires.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2020-09-07-wiring-3/w-2.jpg" title="3-in-1 bundle" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2020-09-07-wiring-3/w-2-thumb.jpg" title="3-in-1 bundle" alt="3-in-1 bundle" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">3-in-1 bundle</p><p>I bent the two power wires for transducers backwards &quot;out&quot; of the connector, and pigtailed a single 20ga wire to them. That looped back into
the connector and hooked up to the pin.</p>
<p>Then, I set myself up on the wing, slouching over the front hole's combing, took my stripper,
and stripped a wire... bam! 2/3ds of the strands came off...</p>
<p>What the..?!</p>
<p>I think the stripper pinched the wire when closing on it, and since I was so much out of position - practically upside down - I didn't notice...</p>
<p>And since I effectively just destroyed ~1/2 inch of the wire, and the wires were cut short....</p>
<p>I lucked out. The wire I was stripping was a standalone ground wire. Moreover, I had two more tails coming from the same source - for the other
two gauges, and the unintentionally shortened tail I just made was just the right length for another gauge.</p>
<p>Phew. Only having to cut two knots, I re-routed the shortened wire to the other gauge, and that gauge's wire to the 3-in-1 bundle.</p>
<p>Tested the stripper multiple times. Yes, I think I just missed the right hole.</p>
<p>Making dead sure I was on this time, I tried again - phew. All worked out.</p>
<p>Slowly, everything got crimped.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">3-in-1 gauge pins</p><p>You can also see that &quot;power loop&quot; in the above picture.</p>
<p>Then, I installed the pins in the housing, and checked the 3-in-1 out. Used a plumber's gauge to pressurize pressure transducers with some
appropriate amount of air and made sure the correct arrow went up on the 3-in-1, and by the right amount.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Testing pressure transducers</p><p>The other three gauges were much easier - because they were further from the 3-in-1 and tie point, for each of them I could trim and crimp
the wires from the cockpit side. I had some fun times with the housing of the tach connector - a DB-9... UMA shipped me a weird sheet metal
shell for it I've never seen that I think needs a special crimper to install, so I ended up replacing it with a regular cheapo plastic after spending
what feels like a few hours trying to find out what the hell that shell was... Failed at that.</p>
<p>At any rate.</p>
<p>The final result? Well..</p>

<hr class="dashed"/><p>Well, we're continuing happily with wiring over here :).</p>
<div class="section" id="wingtips">
<h2>Wingtips</h2>
<p>SkyBeacon and SkySensor were to replace the existing nav lights. Yes, I know, SkySensor is probably a gimmick. But what the hell.</p>
<p>Remo ran nav light wires in a -4 tubing along the front wing spar, using it as kind of a &quot;conduit&quot;, exiting the wires around the wingtip,
and just soldering them to the nav lights he used. Wires were ~3 ft too long, which is a fine &quot;service whip&quot;, but they were just laying on top of the
inside of the fabric of the wingtip. There are no access holes on the wingtip, so no way to get in to tie them up.</p>
<p>Oh well. We work with what we have.</p>
<p>I was going to shorten the wires, and because the lights are on the top wing, I didn't want to solder them - I'd be doing it off of a
ladder, very near if not <em>on</em> the wing's fabric... lots of things to go wrong.</p>
<p>The other thing I didn't want to happen was to have the connection points between the light's wire pigtails and wires in the wings to &quot;rattle
around&quot; the wingtip (with no way of tying them down).</p>
<p>So I had this brilliant idea. The pic is post-realizing the idea was a mistake, with HST cut off....</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2020-09-06-wiring-2/w-1.jpg" title="SkySensor, and cut off HST" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2020-09-06-wiring-2/w-1-thumb.jpg" title="SkySensor, and cut off HST" alt="SkySensor, and cut off HST" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">SkySensor, and cut off HST</p><p>The lights had this plastic tube coming out thru which the wires were routed. I would shorten the pigtails as much as I could (like on the picture
basically), hook'em up to the wing wires with barrel crimps, and put a long piece of my favorite glue-lined SCL tubing over them - with
it glueing itself to the plastic tube and to the wires, creating one rigid &quot;tube&quot; coming off of the light...</p>
<p>Boy was that a mistake.</p>
<p>The tubing glued itself to the wires alright - but not to the plastic tube. So the whole thing created a rattly &quot;lever&quot; that would pull the
wires thru that tube when vibrated - loading the soldered joints on the PCB of the SkySensor.</p>
<p>Not Good At All.</p>
<p>So that idea had to go to trash, and I had to cut the heatshrink off, carefully, with all the glue, without damaging the wires...</p>
<p>And ended up having to do exactly what I was trying to avoid - having rattling connections between the wing wires and the
light, and to solder them. Why solder? Well, because the barrel crimps are heavy, relatively speaking, and I didn't want those heavy &quot;bumps&quot;
bouncing around inside the wingtip, even with HST around them.</p>
<p>So, solder.</p>
<p>From the ladder, on top of the wing, covered in fabric.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Let there be light!</p><p>The other fun part? On the left side, Remo had standard 6-32 tapped holes in whatever the backing of the light socket for the navlight was
made out of. I couldn't really see - maybe a nutplate, maybe just tapped sheet metal.</p>
<p>But on the right side, he used sheet metal screws. Which, of course, I didn't know about till I started putting the lights on - because I
took apart the left side when checking if SkyBeacon will fit, and assumed the other side would be exactly the same. As usual, rookie mistake.
By now, I should know to check everything.</p>
<p>Well, that was a minor delay. Spruce / AN standard doesn't have screws with the right size head (#6 AN screws have heads too large to
fit on the SkyBeacon and SkySensor), so McMaster-Carr had to be resorted to to get the right size and length sheet metal screws.</p>

<div class="section" id="p-leads">
<h2>P-Leads</h2>
<p>The Charger has the Bendix mags, and the P-lead connectors on those are not ring-terminated; instead, using a &quot;screw in&quot; type deal.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2020-09-06-wiring-2/w-2.jpg" title="Bendix type p-lead connector - old wire" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2020-09-06-wiring-2/w-2-thumb.jpg" title="Bendix type p-lead connector - old wire" alt="Bendix type p-lead connector - old wire" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Bendix type p-lead connector - old wire</p><p>Basically, the shielded wire goes thru the outer bushing. The ferrule is a &quot;T&quot;-shaped sleeve, and shield get spread out over the &quot;shank&quot; of the
T. It's squished between the outer bushing's base and the &quot;flat&quot; of the T of the inner ferrule.</p>
<p>The center wire goes thru an insulating spacer (that brown piece), and thru a washer on the other end - with a &quot;button&quot; of solder built on
top of the washer to create a contact point.</p>
<p>The whole contraption gets screwed into the mag's receiving hole with the nut - ferrule rests against the mag's casing, pushing on the insulator
and the solder button to contact the contact point inside the mag, while the nut pushes on the outer bushing and clamps the shield between
it's base and the inner ferrule.</p>
<p>Now, that works with something like 16GA wire, and it's too big with my small 20GA P-leads. Also, notice how beat up the shield on that
setup is? That's the old P-lead.</p>
<p>Folks make adapters for these to go to ring terminals, but they run something like $100 per, which is just silly, so I was determined to
make this work.</p>
<p>Here was my idea, and what it looked like on the right mag. Note <em>two</em> P-lead wires - one of them goes to the front cockpit's tach.</p>
<p>We pigtail the shield.</p>

by .010 too small, to fit over that layer.</p>
<p>Damn.</p>
<p>After playing with various heatshrinks for the outer layer, and trying to slide the bushing on while the HST was hot, I gave up, and...</p>
<p>... just enlarged the hole in the bushing. Yes, I know. The bushing seems to be CAD plated, and I surely took it off (the bushing was magnetic). We'll see how it fares -
if I see rust, I can always buy the adapters for silly prices.</p>

<h2>FWF, finishing up</h2>
<p>And then, the rest of FWF. The only other interesting tidbit was my thinking about the Starter Warning light wire. It's one that goes off of
the &quot;I&quot; terminal of the starter contactor - which goes &quot;hot&quot; when the starter contactor closes - to indicate &quot;starter engaged&quot; with
a light. The whole shebang is probably superficial, but I convinced myself that I wanted it if for nothing else than to maintain &quot;symmetry&quot;
of lights on my panel.</p>
<p>Silly.</p>
<p>Anyway, that wire needed a fuse - though it's an intermittent wire, and I'll admit to thinking about maybe not having a fuse on it,
decided to do it, because it wouldn't harm a thing.</p>
<p>Used a 1A &quot;legged&quot; type PCB mount fuse there.</p>

<hr class="dashed"/><p>Well, damn. With almost a year (no, more than a year!) of my being a caretaker of the Chickenhouse Charger, I
finally was about to actually begin what I have started - which was, putting in <em>my</em> wires.</p>
<p>I decided to start at the switches, and run from the panel forward. Some wires will terminate at the fuse blocks
(power feeds), and some will go forward - to the front panel, voltage regulator, and firewall forward.</p>
<p>Then, I was planning to run a few wires backwards - the ones that were pre-terminated on my transducers (fuel,
oil pressures, oil temp, and mag pickup for the tach).</p>
<p>Immediately, I will admit: <strong>that was a mistake</strong>. While the harness turned out alright, it could've been
much neater - if I ran in one direction. I could've made sure the whole thing is wire to wire and perfectly
clean. So I should've run front to back, because my pre-terminated wires all &quot;started&quot; upfront.</p>
<p>In other words, prop to tail. Well sigh. Next time. On the other hand, this approach would've made terminating
switches at the panel a nightmare. That was, initially, the reason why I wanted to start at the panel - so that
I'd pre-attach wires to switches, tie them up, and then trim them at the other end.</p>
<p>At any rate.... Shall we?</p>
<div class="section" id="prep">
<h2>Prep</h2>
<p>Couple things to knock off before I started wiring was to complete the back panel. One thing that was
left was the compass correction card bracket. No problem, drilled and tapped a couple holes for #2 brass screws.</p>
<p>Here's Mr. M. installing it:</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Compass Correction Card Bracket</p><p>The other one was the inertia switch for the smoke system. Glenn had it in for &quot;safety&quot;: in the event of a
shock (crash?) the switch breaks the circuit. I am.. not sure why he would have it, but he had it.</p>
<p>I considered not putting it back in, but what the hell.</p>
<p>Here's the switch:</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2020-07-26-wiring-1/w-1.jpg" title="Shock switch" >

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Shock switch</p><p>The problem was, it sat tightly between other switches in the panel. With old layout, that barely worked; but with
the new layout, and Honeywell double throw switches, the connector plug was getting in the way. So I had to resort
to some vandalism. :)</p>

<div class="section" id="panel">
<h2>Panel</h2>
<p>Now ready, I decided to install the switches first, and then wire them from the back. I needed a couple short jumpers
though to connect them, and to set up some wires to be the exact length. That'd be impossible with switches
installed in the panel (too little access), so I set up an old placard plate, installed switches into it,
and worked on those jumpers and terminations on the bench before moving them to the airplane.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Somewhere in the middle of running the wires</p><p>I think it happened when I was yet again sitting in the cockpit, clicking the switches and enjoying the very

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Engine starter engaged position - note that I can hit the starter and hold the throttle with the same hand</p><p>...when it dawned on me...</p>
<p>My three most important switches, L and R Mags, and Master, were set up with lockouts - you couldn't turn them on
just by clicking them, instead, having to pull the lever first to move it to the &quot;on&quot; position. I mostly
did that to protect from accidental too playful a kid in the cockpit.</p>
<p>But they weren't locked out in the &quot;on&quot; position!</p>
<p>Why is that important? Well, the Smoke and the Fuel Pump - the most <em>operated</em> switches on this plane - are
right there. Note how their levers are shorter? If I accidentally hit the longer levered Master, or a Mag, switch,
that would turn it <em>off</em> - with me potentially shutting down the motor. While a remote possibility, improving
the situation would amount to just replacing the switches to the ones with lockouts in <em>both</em> on <em>and</em> off positions.</p>
<p>I don't know how I missed that when designing the original setup...</p>
<p>I decided to do it.</p>
<p>So out came the switches, I had to un-wire the terminals from the back. In went the order for three new
switches with now correct lock-outs.</p>
<p>About a week later, I had them, and could proceed.</p>
<p>With left side wired up, I could tie it down. Mind you, access there is tight and from all kinds of
weird angles :).</p>

I had firewall, motor, &quot;side conduit&quot;, and panel, as ground points - all bonded with those straps.</p>
<p>Here's the right side:</p>

<p>I also had some fun with ADELs right where the wires turn from the &quot;side conduit&quot; towards the panel.
I had to clear and negotiate a couple bowdens, and the engine monitor harness was unwieldy.</p>
<p>I think that took a number of hours, just trying various setups, the final one that I really liked was this:</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Engine monitor and carb heat bowden.</p><p>I replaced all the ugly zipties with lacing, of course :).</p>
<p>Meanwhile, on the outside, to keep the wires nicely separated, I spread them out in kind of a &quot;fan&quot; in the order
they ran, back to front:</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Wire fan</p><p>A day later, I replaced the tape with a comb. Yep, a cheapo $1 comb :) Worked out great.</p>
<p>And finally, before committing and continuing, I checked each wire for gauge, and proper circuitry.</p>

<h2>Side Contuit, Part I</h2>
<p>With all those wires sticking out, it was now time to start figuring out routing in the side conduit. All the wires
that had to go forward had, well, to go forward.</p>
<p>After lots of fiddling, I ended up with this:</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Initial stab at the side conduit routing</p><p>I had to clear all the brackets, and other sharp things. Ended up adding a couple more ADELs (and drilling holes

<p>The most interesting piece in it was a Westach tach, that fed directly off of a P-Lead and required a .25A
fuse. Glenn used a 1A classic glass fuse, but I decided to do it right. See, the thing is, if it fails &quot;short
circuit&quot;, that'd turn off the mag - I guess that's why the fuse is in there.</p>
<p>The tach would get another 20GA shielded wire, just like a p-lead, and I decided to join it to right mag's
p-lead at the magneto - instead of splicing it into the p-lead running front to back in the side conduit.</p>
<p>But, back to the fuse. I figured, I'd build it into my connector that hooks up to the tach. Then, if blown,
the connector could be rebuilt. Yep, it's more annoying than a regular replaceable fuse, but that circuit is
not critical, and I had no room for a &quot;regular&quot; fuse block or holder.</p>
<p>So I got me a &quot;legged&quot; .25A fuse with a massive voltage rating (I forget what it was, but definitely above
what a mag makes), and hooked it to a regular Molex pin.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">On the tach</p><p>The lead is just a regular pigtailed P-lead, of course. Notice how I like using SCL around individual Molex pins
for added strain relief - that's because I can't produce good Molex crimps that I like; and I end up post-soldering
them in addition to crimping. That strain relief ensures that soldered joint is firmly held immobile. Takes a bit
of extra time, but I actually like that better than straight Molex crimps.</p>
<p>The rest of the front panel wasn't interesting, just annoying. There's only three circuits there: nav lights wires
from the left wing run along the back of the panel to the right side where the conduit is, and then there's hobbs
and tach, and that's it. It was just very annoying: with very little access, not being able to see things,
and, being in the front hole, having to climb out and in every time I needed a tool I forgot to put close (when
in the back hole, I can roll up a cart to it and have all my tools there).</p>
<p>Mirror was absolutely required.</p>

<h2>Firewall Forward</h2>
<p>The final set of wires to join the main harness were all the wires coming from the firewall side - mainly,
transducers and other instrumentation wires, but also a couple wires for the voltage regulator.</p>
<p>This was precisely when I realized the mistake I talked about in the beginning - and ended up with less
neat, and more tortured harness. Oh well.</p>
<p>I started up front, trimming and terminating my fat wires for the starter and alternator B-feed. Some more extreme
soldering (to cap them), this time with a torch.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2020-07-26-wiring-1/w-77.jpg" title="More extreme soldering" >

 </a> <p class="small text-center">More extreme soldering</p><p>I tied up, and clamped the fat bundle to the motor: and apparently, didn't take a single picture.</p>
<p>Then, I had to figure out the diode for the Starter contactor - first of, it needed longer leads. There, instead
of soldering, I used small barrel crimps from Molex along with heatshrink (I do use them where soldering is
impractical, and I decided not to have soldered joints FWF).</p>

<p>I <a class="reference external" href="http://79ft.net/entries/2019-06-18-fuselinks/">tested them a while back</a>, and am confident they'll work.</p>
<p>First, we take a wire 4 &quot;gauge steps&quot; thinner than the fused one (so 24GA for 20GA fused, etc). That goes
into the &quot;source&quot; terminal.</p>

them later.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="tail-light">
<h2>Tail Light</h2>
<p>I got rid of the belly strobe on the plane, because it was too heavy and too.. useless. Wingtip lights are gonna be the SkyBeacon
and SkySensor from uAvionix (my ADSB mandate compliance :) ), and they have strobes: but they're not visible from the back. So
I decided to replace the tail nav light with an LED nav/strobe.</p>
<p>Problem number one: no ground wire going to the tail light. For whatever reason, Remo decided to basically use the fact that the
tail light is hooked up to the rudder with a pair of screws thru sheet metal of the rear rudder bow... I don't even want to begin to think what
the ground path would be: hinges? control cables?</p>
<p>So, I needed a second wire.</p>
<p>Problem number two: it had to be one neat cable, and it had to be of a smallish diameter (Remo had an old 20GA wire, which is thicker
than modern 20GA tefzel wire).</p>
<p>I decided to use a chunk of  20GA shielded - same ones I used for p-leads. Technically I guess you're not supposed to do that, but it's
very far from all the antennas and I'm crossing my fingers that it won't create too much problems. Thickness was spot on.</p>
<p>So, I soldered the new piece to the old wire, and fished it thru using old wire as a pull. That part was scary - if that didn't
work, I would've had to cut holes in the rudder to get a new wire thru.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">All hooked up!</p><p>On the other end (on the tail fin side) the wire went into a hole on the inspection cover, and had to join the wire coming from the front.
And I had to have the ground there. You can see that area right behind the elevator on the &quot;fishing wire thru&quot; picture.</p>
<p>Problem number three: <em>nothing</em> to hook up the ground to in that area. The only option I figured out  was to use one of the rivnuts that are
attached to the tabs welded to the frame, hoping that there's no corrosion there between the aluminum rivnut and steel fuselage. I figured I'd
use a way too long a screw thru one of the rivnuts when attaching that inspection cover, and then pull the ring terminal onto it, and secure it
against the back side of the rivnut with a nut and a washer. Ugly? Yes; but I didn't have any more options. Really, the right way to do that
would be to run two wires from the pilot panel all the way back, but.. I'd have to start cutting fabric for that.</p>
<p>So, I attached the positive to the wire that was already there, terminated my ground, hooked everything up, hooked up some power, and...</p>
<p>Nothing.</p>
<p>A bit of debugging showed that... ground was the problem. Damn! I picked the wrong rivnut, I guess - it had corrosion.
The one right on the other side though showed the right voltage when measured against the positive lead, so I just moved everything to the
other side, and...</p>

<p>First, conduit, cockpit side. Lots of crossing things, lots of padding for bowdens where they cross the wires (I used the right
sized vinyl tubing from my local friendly Aerospace Depot, and lacing to tie it).</p>
<p>Engine monitor harness got covered in tube for quite a distance - there was no way to keep it off and not rubbing on the conduit.</p>

money on shipping small-headed #10 screws (the screws in the terminals are #8 but with small &quot;oval&quot; rather than &quot;pan&quot; aviation style head,
so I'd have to get me some decent screws from McMaster.. by the time I'd be done, it'd be close to those $35).</p>

<hr class="dashed"/><p>This was a small project to wrap up everything I could do firewall forward before moving on to the panel and main wiring.</p>
<p>I wanted to clean up the engine monitor probes harness. When Glenn installed it, he used zipties everywhere (and actually
everything on the plane was ziptied). Nothing wrong with that, except where zipties were used around motor mount and the like
without any cushioning.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2020-05-01-probes/p-1.jpg" title="Probe wires with zipties" >

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Probe wires with zipties</p><p>But last I checked, zipties weren't used in the 1930s. No, in the 1930s grass was greener, trees taller, water wetter,
and Real Men used wire lacing to tie their wiring harnesses together.</p>
<p>And using adel clamps on round tube is just good karma.</p>
<p>So, I re-did one side first.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2020-05-01-probes/p-2.jpg" title="Properly laced and mounted" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2020-05-01-probes/p-2-thumb.jpg" title="Properly laced and mounted" alt="Properly laced and mounted" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Properly laced and mounted</p><p>Much better isn't it? Those wing nuts are temporary - I will replace them all with real ones when finishing up FWF much later.</p>
<p>I did the other side, though didn't tie it up yet - there will be more wires joining that branch later, and I had to wait until
they were done. But, I did set up all the adel clamps - about 4 pairs of them total.</p>
<p>Next, came the carb temp probe. I had to extend it's wire, and hook it back into the main harness. I repositioned it a long time
ago because I ditched the Rotec TBI, and the old wire was just a touch too short.</p>
<p>I spent quite a bit of time making sure that it's a thermocouple, and that I can reliably extend it - with same material and type
thermocouple wire. I did some basic tests with extending it and making sure it shows reasonable numbers. It did.</p>
<p>I thought a couple times about ditching it; but decided to keep it if I could, and my tests showed that I could do that.</p>
<p>Mounting and routing ended up looking something like this:</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2020-05-01-probes/p-3.jpg" title="Carb temp probe wire" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2020-05-01-probes/p-3-thumb.jpg" title="Carb temp probe wire" alt="Carb temp probe wire" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Carb temp probe wire</p><p>From there, it'd go straight to the motor mount (towards the firewall), and join the engine monitor harness.</p>
<p>When extending the thermocouple, the easiest thing to do is make sure that the joining thermocouple wires mesh together - this
way, you're not introducing a section of a dissimilar metal between two segments.</p>
<p>To do that, I used simple Molex &quot;barrel&quot; butt splices that allow you to put one wire on top of another and crimp around. You
then heatshrink the joint. In fact, I'm starting to like them, and am thinking about using them instead of the usual AMP butt
splices with nylon insulation. They are much cleaner and compact, and heatshrink I use here (SCL) provides ample
strain relief (it shrinks to hard plastic, and glues itself to the wire).</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Extension being put on</p><p>I shrunk each crimp individually, and then another chunk around the whole thing. The whole thing was set up to be held by a
second clamp (you'll see it in the picture a bit further down).</p>
<p>Back when I <a class="reference external" href="http://79ft.net/entries/cgr-30/">installed the CGR-30</a> on the Cheetah, I encapsulated all the
probe wires into fiberglass sleeve, and here it'd fit perfect - to support the lonely wire spanning about a foot to the motor mount.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Fiberglass sleeve</p><p>I also used CGR's &quot;barrel connectors&quot; to hook up to the harness end. They have the wires &quot;mesh&quot; together, and fix them with a
grubscrew, making the whole thing removable. Not sure when I'd want to do that, but I wanted to have an option.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Barrel connectors hooking up to the main lead</p><p>Before closing it up, I tested everything. The probe had to be in the carb, so the best I could figure was to check if the ambient

very close to the adel clamp holding the fiberglass sleeve to the airbox, on the right side - and remember, it's in hard plastic
that the heatshrink that's under the fiberglass sleeve turned into - so I'm not concerned about the joint failing there.</p>

<p>There were some more holes left after removing some old things. They were for #6 or #8 screws; and I could barely access the other

<p>Instead of attempting to maneuver nuts back there, I wanted to try something along a rivnut.. but a bit better. Steel.</p>
<p>Spruce sells these steel &quot;nutserts&quot;, which seemed to fit the bill. Got a set, with install tooling.</p>

<h2>Fat Wires</h2>
<p>The contactors got mounted and torque sealed (of course I forgot to add a diode jumper to the starter contactor, will have
to add later). Next, came figuring out the alternator wire and battery contactor -&gt; shunt jumper (main buss feeder from the battery
basically).</p>
<p>Initially, I thought I could route the alternator wire on the right side of the motor; keeping the starter on the left (remember,
the firewall layout on this plane is reversed of sorts - with battery and oil cooler having their locations swapped and producing
all sorts of grief due to that).</p>
<p>While not bad, holding the alternator wire on the firewall would've required more holes, and it'd go straight down, at
90 degrees to the main harness on the firewall (going left to right), kinda &quot;crossing&quot; it under. So I gave that idea up pretty quick,
instead deciding to run it along that main harness - neatness and 1 less hole/clamp instead of a shorter by about a foot run.</p>

<p>Mr. Max made a comment that it's the music that's distracting me (he was busy building his &quot;water system&quot; out
of the old fuel system hoses and fittings <a class="reference external" href="http://79ft.net/entries/2020-04-29-hosed/">I took out</a> at the time).</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">The initial setup</p><p>I did not like this. See how tight that Master &lt;-&gt; Starter contactor jumper is? It was very tight. The rigid alternator wire
hooked into the ring on the master contactor side was too tight too (that adel clamp that I needed to hold stuff under the
starter contactor had to be there - there will be other wires bundled there later). It was so tight that it bent the ring
when I attempted to set it up.</p>
<p>No, that wasn't good at all.... hmmm..</p>
<p>Aha! I did a similar trick with the gascolator! <a class="reference external" href="http://79ft.net/entries/2020-04-29-hosed/">Reverse the flow</a>.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Flow reversed starter contactor</p><p>Much better! All I did was swapped the jumper from the Master contactor, and the starter lead on the starter contactor; and, while
that made the fat red wire jumper much longer, it made the whole setup much, much cleaner. It made the buss feed wire a bit less pretty,
arguably, with that weird &quot;dip&quot;, but there's no avoiding it. I'll live with that.</p>

torch, and add &quot;solder caps&quot;.</p>

<h2>Ground Strap</h2>
<p>This plane didn't have any. The battery was grounded to the motor (good - the biggest current demand is from the starter). The motor
wasn't grounded to anything else at all, making the current flow thru probably the control cables and fuel hoses to the rest of
the plane. Not good.</p>
<p>So, one was needed. That took more thinking and fiddling. I had a plan initially to ground the battery to the motor and the
motor mount (Grummans do something similar - battery to firewall; and motor mount to motor) - but I wasn't sure about
how good a connection there is between the motor mount and the firewall. So I decided to jump the motor to the firewall -
a very common setup.</p>

<h2>Battery Box</h2>
<p>Battery leads were easy to make. Had to fiddle a bit with grommets (holes in the box are much larger than wires, and I had to
use a &quot;hose section around a wire in the grommet&quot; trick to keep the wire tight and nice.</p>
<p>The battery box was another matter though.</p>
<p>Glenn had replaced the original large (&quot;standard&quot;) battery with a small Odyssey - and took out the space with a bunch of chunks
of random foam...</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Foam</p><p>The box had &quot;dimples&quot; for the battery to stand on, lifted off the bottom (the bottom was made into a funnel of sorts that ended in a
drain - setup for an old school battery that could leak acid). Those dimples were sized for a full size battery, so Odyssey couldn't stand on them.</p>
<p>So, .. ahem.. the solution was?</p>

<p>I hooked up the leads, routed them out of the box, and closed it up, only to realize that the battery was loose in the &quot;up and down&quot;

it <em>is</em> aerobatic after all!)</p>
<p>Ordered some foam from McMaster, and padded the top of the box, and the battery sides.</p>

<p>And with that, I moved on. The main layout was done - the rest of tightening, tying, and strapping has to be done when all the
wires are in, close to the end of this rebuild.</p>

<hr class="dashed"/><p>A couple things have been always on the back burner - fuse blocks, and finishing up the oil cooler bowden hookup.</p>
<p>In between waiting for completion of The Thing I Am Yet To Write About, finally, checked those off the list.</p>
<div class="section" id="fuse-blocks">
<h2>Fuse Blocks</h2>
<p>Location was figured out <a class="reference external" href="http://79ft.net/entries/2019-09-08-fwf-side-channel-panel-layouts/">a long time ago</a>, and I just
clamped them in place, center punched the holes, and drilled them.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Clamped in place for hole marking</p><p>One little bit was to figure out the exact fastener lengths and washer stacks, because the right one had it's right (forward most) end riding
on top of a reasonably thick aluminum placard you will see much better in the following picture.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Fuse blocks: mounted</p><p>Done! Done?</p>
<p>You are forgetting, my Dear Reader. We here are in the <em>misery</em> business. Look carefully at the curvature of the fuselage. Imagine the
side panel, open on the pictures, closed over our &quot;conduit&quot;, on which the fuse blocks are installed. Do you see how the available &quot;depth&quot;
will be bigger in the middle of the conduit as compared to the top?</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>Of course, the panel won't close. With fuses installed, they would rub on the side panel. Not Good.</p>
<p>But relocating them down? What's the problem? Bowden cables, of course! I'd be too close to them, and I wanted very much to isolate my
wire bundle and my bowdens; but even if I didn't, I still won't have enough room there for a terminal, and a nice 90 degree &quot;turn&quot; for the
wire to go sideways (either towards the panel, or towards the firewall).</p>
<p>Solution?</p>
<p>Well.. there weren't any good ones, so I ended up taking the best of the crappy ones.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Final fuseblock mount locations</p><p>Not ideal, because they're flipped over - so <em>technically</em>, condensation can run down and into the fuse socket. Not a good situation to be
in, but I can't do anything here. I guess, inspecting this area for corrosion is going to be on my Regular Maintenance List.</p>
<p>Oh, and I ended up with four <em>extra</em> perfectly drilled and deburred holes, right in the passenger's cockpit. That's what is on the other side
of that &quot;conduit&quot;.</p>
<p>I guess, I will attach a placard to them stating that those are &quot;hole samples&quot; or something (my friend Dick Gossen placarded a missing screw in his instrument panel once,
so I figure I am allowed as well).</p>

<h2>Oil Cooler Bowden</h2>
<p>When <a class="reference external" href="http://79ft.net/entries/2019-09-08-fwf-side-channel-panel-layouts/">headscratching about</a>, and later
<a class="reference external" href="http://79ft.net/entries/2019-10-09-vr-mounted/">installing the voltage regulator</a>, Oil Cooler Air Shutoff Valve bowden was relocated
(and because of that, I had to use a longer Bowden, which, gladly, I had an extra of after removing the Rotec's Throttle Body Injector).</p>
<p>All that was left was cut it to size, and install it into the valve's pivot arm.</p>
<p>Cutting bowdens? I don't know, I think it's easy. Pull out the actual control wire, and use bolt cutters. Push the wire back in, and trim
to desired length.</p>
<p>Done.</p>
<p>Here's the pivot arm.</p>

<p>The other minor problem? The hole that clamps the &quot;eye&quot; that holds the bowden's outer housing in place was drilled too close to the place
where the eye begins. Result? Flat washer was too big to lay flat.</p>
<p>Oh well.</p>

<p>They were done <a class="reference external" href="http://79ft.net/entries/2019-11-23-switch-plates/">quite some time ago</a>. I center punched the holes in the panel for the #2 attach screws when test-fitting

<hr class="dashed"/><p>While waiting for someone else to get back to me to help me finish &lt;the thing that took last month and a half
and  is yet to be written about&gt;, I decided to work on the panel a bit.</p>
<p>Lighting strip seemed like a nice place to start.</p>
<p>It's a simple LED strip that I planned to glue right behind coaming on the underside of the eyebrow. This way, it'd be
invisible from pretty much any angle.</p>
<p>But, the wires! The wires in <em>front</em> of the panel, that have to go to the behinds.. No worries I thought, I'd make  a small
hole / slit in the top of the panel, also invisible - and fish the wires thru there.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2020-01-29-light-and-compass/lc-1.jpg" title="The Plan" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2020-01-29-light-and-compass/lc-1-thumb.jpg" title="The Plan" alt="The Plan" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">The Plan</p><p>That was the plan.</p>
<p>Reality, of course, decided to disagree.</p>
<p>The plan was to take out all the screws that went around the top of the panel, and tilt it &quot;down&quot; - so that I
could use a drill comfortably to make the little slit for the wires.</p>
<p>Couple screws came out nice.</p>
<p>I think the third one came out like...</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2020-01-29-light-and-compass/lc-2.jpg" title="?!" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2020-01-29-light-and-compass/lc-2-thumb.jpg" title="?!" alt="?!" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">?!</p><p>Did I just bust a screw? I looked into the hole. <em>Empty?!</em></p>
<p>Upon further examination, I found... glue? What? The screw head was... glued into the hole? That's a first.</p>
<p>After taking the rest of the screws out, I realized what happened.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2020-01-29-light-and-compass/lc-3.jpg" title="Backside of the panel" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2020-01-29-light-and-compass/lc-3-thumb.jpg" title="Backside of the panel" alt="Backside of the panel" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Backside of the panel</p><p>This is the back side of the panel. The panel is attached thru those little tabs and nutplates.</p>
<p>Notice the nutplates using rigid (not floating) style nuts? A slight misdrilling of the holes in the panel, and screws
won't go in at all.</p>
<p>So, there were two &quot;screws&quot; that were just heads glued in - yep - and two more that used #6 screw in a #8 nut - the TPI on those is the same, and the holes were drilled sufficiently close enough to let a #6 screw pass thru; but not a #8. Le.. Sigh.</p>
<p>To top it all off, the panel won't fold down for me to get access to where I wanted to be, and to fish it out I'd have to take
out the carb heat bowden cable that was attached to it. Too much trouble if I can avoid it (that carb heat cable would've
been a 3-4 hour affair just by itself).</p>
<p>Plan B solidified; but first the panel had to be put back.</p>
<p>I ended up putting #6 screws into all the misdrilled holes (sorry, but glueing heads into holes is.. not my thing :)); but I installed nuts on them on the back. Effectively, set up like this the nutplates don't do anything - just add weight. See
the picture above - it has the nut over that nutplate. That nut, by the way, was a pain to get in - see how close another nut is to it?</p>
<p>I think all the fiddling with the panel, screws, nuts, washers (losing a few of them and going on fishing expedition
to pull them out of the guts of the plane included, of course), and trying to get it back in right took what.. around 6 hours?</p>
<p>The plan B, now executable after the panel was back in, was to route the wire under the eyebrow, and fish it thru behind
the coaming to the &quot;top&quot; side right in the middle, where the compass was to be. It then would join the compass light
wire, and go to behind the panel land.</p>
<p>So, the strip was glued, and the wire attached to under the eyebrow with <em>HVAC duct sealing tape</em>, ahem, aircraft grade
glue backed aluminum sheeting from the local friendly Aerospace Depot.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Strip glued - looking up</p><p>That picture's taken &quot;from under, looking up&quot;. Ugly? Well, not too easy to make it pretty doing it basically blind with
an inspection mirror the only view. Like this:</p>

<hr class="dashed"/><p>This is all your fault, you know who!</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Way back, when working on the new layout for switches on the panel, I was thinking about how to re-label them.</p>
<p>I had a nice Brady label maker, and was thinking about just printing and sticking some tags over existing, painted, lettering,
on the switch placards.</p>
<p>One of the nights, when I was tired enough to do anything useful, I was playing with the stickers, and posted this picture
here:</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-11-23-switch-plates/p-100.jpg" title="Playing with placards" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-11-23-switch-plates/p-100-thumb.jpg" title="Playing with placards" alt="Playing with placards" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Playing with placards</p><p>The you-know-who-you-are, of course, wasn't happy (this gentleman is an actual friend of mine, not a silly voice in my head).
&quot;They will fall off&quot;, he said. &quot;Can't you do something a bit more professional&quot;? &quot;Can't you draw them up, and order them to be custom made&quot;?</p>
<p>Order?</p>
<p>Ha!</p>
<p>No. This whole exercise in airplane handling is to put yourself thru as much misery as possible. So the placards had to be
made, not ordered. I mean, I could've ordered my electrical redone too, right? :)</p>
<p>I recalled that I read somewhere on Vintage Machinery that someone figured out a neat way to restore old
data plates on old lathes and such. Looking it up, I remembered.</p>
<p>Etching!</p>
<p>The idea is basic - make a mask, transfer it to a piece of metal, soak it in acid, paint, sand - your recessed (etched) areas will
keep paint, while the elevated (masked out) areas will sand out. This way, you get metal-on-paint look, and it's nice and
pretty.</p>
<p>So, it has been decided - I will etch out my switch placards!</p>
<p>First, though, I had to figure out...</p>
<div class="section" id="the-process">
<h2>The Process</h2>
<p>Obviously, SolidWorks would be instrumental in making the actual pattern. I wanted to make the placards out of brass, so that
lettering would be yellow, and I'd paint them black, for the yellow on black final result.</p>
<p>First, the mask.</p>
<p>Searching around, it seemed that the most reasonable way to go about it would be to use Toner Transfer technique. Laser printer
toner (at least on a good subset of laser printers) is basically powdered plastic. Printer warms it up, which makes it sticky -
and toner then fuses itself to
paper. It can be re-softened (and made sticky again) by a normal household iron or a laminator. I had both - an iron, obviously;
but we also had a great &quot;office grade&quot; laminator in the office.</p>
<p>A lot of folks had success with glossy paper (glossy paper doesn't absorb melted toner, it sticks, but stays on top), but I, looking
around, found a lot of good reviews of the <a class="reference external" href="https://pcbfx.com">PCB Fab in a Box</a> system.</p>
<p>Not only the guy makes a very nice toner transfer paper which &quot;releases&quot; the toner when soaked in water (it works just like your
model decals in plastic models, you soak the paper, and the top layer comes off), he also seems to have researched and cleaned up
the process to minutia. For example, the toner itself is porous (indeed!) so he uses an extra layer of plastic to &quot;fuse&quot; the
micro-gaps between toner granulas as transferred  with another layer called &quot;TRF Foil&quot;. He also did a lot of research into
printers, toners, application techniques and such - and published a great handbook. Just for that alone, I wanted him to have my
money.</p>
<p>So, I ordered the transfer paper (the one you print your mask on), and tried the first step - transferring it to a small strip of
brass in a laminator.</p>

   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-11-23-switch-plates/p-2-thumb.jpg" title="Transferred!" alt="Transferred!" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Transferred!</p><p>What's wrong with that picture? Riiight! I forgot to mirror the pattern :). Damn.</p>
<p>I messed around quite a bit with density, too. Just default settings were crap, obviously. Bumping up the density to max didn't help
much. I installed a new toner cartridge, and that improved the density dramatically - while not perfect, it would've been workable,
hopefully, with the addition of the TRF foil (and, if I saw any obvious holes, I could fill them with a sharpie).</p>
<p>Okay. But the basic test worked! The pattern transferred nicely.</p>
<p>Second time, I threw together another test mask with a couple of different fonts about the size I'd want on the placards -
I was gonna transfer those to a small chunk of brass bar stock, and try etching.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-11-23-switch-plates/p-5.jpg" title="Second pattern" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-11-23-switch-plates/p-5-thumb.jpg" title="Second pattern" alt="Second pattern" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Second pattern</p><p>With the help of child labor, patterns were cut out, and transferred successfully to the brass bar stock.
I then applied the green TRF foil (that stuff that fuses the pores between toner's grains) to it.</p>
<p>Side note: the process manual from <a class="reference external" href="https://pcbfx.com">PCB Fab in a Box</a> notes explicitly that Brother printers have a kind
of toner that requires much higher than usual laminator's temps to melt. I have a Brother printer, but  since I was able to do
my first transfer successfully, I kinda decided to not bother - it worked, so I must be the lucky one right? Though I admit, I did entertain an idea of a new
printer... ;)</p>
<p>On one of the evenings, I had a block of a few hours, and the weather was nice. I had all my chemicals (ferric chloride PCB
etching solution and boxes of baking soda to neutralize it afterwards), so I decided to try the actual etching process.</p>
<p>I hooked up the test plate to a piece of closed cell foam (to float it on top of acid)...</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-11-23-switch-plates/p-8.jpg" title="Brass with mask hooked up" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-11-23-switch-plates/p-8-thumb.jpg" title="Brass with mask hooked up" alt="Brass with mask hooked up" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Brass with mask hooked up</p><p>...set up a small plastic table outside the hangar...</p>

   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-11-23-switch-plates/p-7-thumb.jpg" title="The setup" alt="The setup" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">The setup</p><p>...and went to town.</p>
<p>The idea was to try to get the ferric chloride to about 100 degrees F to speed up the process, so I did a hot water tub (hence, the
little camp stove in my setup).</p>
<p>I'd have a large tub with hot water, and a small tub with etching solution in it, with the workpiece floating on top, hooked up to
the foam.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-11-23-switch-plates/p-9.jpg" title="Etch, etch away!" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-11-23-switch-plates/p-9-thumb.jpg" title="Etch, etch away!" alt="Etch, etch away!" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Etch, etch away!</p><p>It took about 40-50 minutes, I think, till I was comfortable with the depth of etching. Every 10ish minutes I'd pull the piece out,
and brush it with etchant to clear the debris that, I thought, would collect in small nooks and crannies (I saw a guy do that on
one of the videos I watched).</p>
<p>After a decent etching depth was achieved, I pulled it out, and dunked it in soda to neutralize the acid.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-11-23-switch-plates/p-10.jpg" title="Neutralizing" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-11-23-switch-plates/p-10-thumb.jpg" title="Neutralizing" alt="Neutralizing" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Neutralizing</p><p>Then, lots of rinsing, while catching water into a tub. Acid, even neutralized, will contain dissolved copper, and just dumping
it is not good. I was planning to keep the tub and let water evaporate, at which point I could just wipe off the powdery residue.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-11-23-switch-plates/p-11.jpg" title="All cleaned up" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-11-23-switch-plates/p-11-thumb.jpg" title="All cleaned up" alt="All cleaned up" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">All cleaned up</p><p>After that, a rag with acetone wipes off the mask, and...</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-11-23-switch-plates/p-12.jpg" title="Etched!" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-11-23-switch-plates/p-12-thumb.jpg" title="Etched!" alt="Etched!" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Etched!</p><p>The edges on the letters (basically, the edges of the mask) are very rough there. On these test ones, I started with a maroon
pad, but quickly went to a 120 grit non-woven deburring wheel, which cleaned it up nice (and of course, messed up the letters -
well, lesson learned, I won't use that aggressive a method on the real thing).</p>
<p>Later, when painting, I noticed that the mask was still porous, letting some acid in (I had some tiny &quot;cavities&quot; in random spots).
It looked pretty good when applied.  This would become obvious later, when I started adding color. I suspected the old drum, and decided to get a
new drum for the printer - though in hindsight, I think this is, after all, the problem of me having the Brother printer
(read on ;) ). Meanwhile, I ordered a new drum and a new cartridge.</p>
<p>And then, the paint.</p>
<p>I wanted &quot;golden&quot; letters on &quot;black&quot; background. I wanted to make the whole piece black, and then sand it on a flat surface -
everything that was masked would have the black sanded off, and the rest would keep it, achieving the effect.</p>
<p>I wanted to try a couple different &quot;make it black&quot; approaches. One would be forced oxidation with something like a gun blueing
acid, and the other would be plain paint. I had two test areas, which would allow be to try both at the same time.</p>
<p>So I blued one side....</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Blued with Brownell Oxpho-Blue</p><p>... and sanded it down.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-11-23-switch-plates/p-15.jpg" title="Sanded down" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-11-23-switch-plates/p-15-thumb.jpg" title="Sanded down" alt="Sanded down" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Sanded down</p><p>Couple notes on blueing. I tried Brownells Oxpho-Blue, and then later Birchwood Casey Brass Black. Both produce a layer of black
oxide on the brass. There are a couple of problems, though.</p>
<p>First of, the etched surface is not perfect - and those imperfections are not really hidden by oxidizing, obviously. Second,
and bigger, problem, is that that oxide is powdery, and can be rubbed off easily with even a paper towel, given enough elbow
grease. I was afraid I'd have adhesion problems with the top coat (I was gonna coat the whole thing in clear to prevent tarnishing
of letters), so I decided against it.</p>
<p>The other side I decided to put just your basic schedule of Rustoleum - primer, and flat black.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">All done.</p><p>I waited for about a week with the Rustoleum side, and then sanded it down.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-11-23-switch-plates/p-23.jpg" title="Rustoleum sanded down" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-11-23-switch-plates/p-23-thumb.jpg" title="Rustoleum sanded down" alt="Rustoleum sanded down" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Rustoleum sanded down</p><p>I liked that side much better. However, the primer, being white, would show in between the paint and the letters, being noticeable.
I decided to find some black primer - and meanwhile, coated the whole thing in lacquer, which I decided to use as a top coat.</p>
<p>Mistake! A few weeks later, lacquer started flaking off. Yeah, I learned the &quot;no lacquer on top of  enamel&quot; rule. But it was
flaking off on plain brass too, so.. lacquer was no way to go.</p>
<p>Just typing that, in hindsight, maybe there was some acid residue after blueing... but acid was dried, and I
used acetone to clean up the blued side. But again, clear brass had lacquer coming off as well.</p>
<p>Worse part is, the enamel lifted and was coming off in pieces.</p>
<p>So instead, I did something that in hindsight I think was a mistake. I decided to look for a better paint solution,
and very quickly arrived at epoxy, specifically, <a class="reference external" href="www.klasskote.com">Klass Kote</a>. It seems to be used by a lot of RC builders
very successfully, I saw successful reports of brushing it, and talked to them, too. I was sold. Again, in hindsight... I think
this was a mistake. But, read on. :)</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-actual-mask">
<h2>The Actual Mask</h2>
<p>To make the actual mask for the actual plates, I used my
<a class="reference external" href="http://79ft.net/entries/2019-08-31-alternator-pivot-arm/">scan-and-draw-around-it</a> Solidworks trick. I scanned the old placards,
and sketched around them.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-11-23-switch-plates/swx-sketch.jpg" title="Sketch" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-11-23-switch-plates/swx-sketch-thumb.jpg" title="Sketch" alt="Sketch" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Sketch</p><p>I very quickly discovered that on one of them, the sides were not parallel; and the holes were all not on one line, and not
evenly spaced! :). So, I made two versions - one all nice and even, and the other just like the old placards.</p>
<p>Using a bit of cardstock, I tried each of them on to make sure the holes are okay and such...</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-11-23-switch-plates/p-20.jpg" title="Trying on the pattern" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-11-23-switch-plates/p-20-thumb.jpg" title="Trying on the pattern" alt="Trying on the pattern" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Trying on the pattern</p><p>Guess which ones fit better? Yep, the crooked ones! Straightening them out made holes not line up with holes in the panel, and one
of them would interfere with some screws on the panel. Oh well.</p>
<p>Then, came quite some hours (that I didn't log to be honest) fiddling with the font and the layout. I decided to use &quot;Magneto&quot;,
the kick ass italic font out of the four I tried on my test etch.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-11-23-switch-plates/cool-font.jpg" title="Plates with the cool font" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-11-23-switch-plates/cool-font-thumb.jpg" title="Plates with the cool font" alt="Plates with the cool font" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Plates with the cool font</p><p>But, the same gentleman who made me undertake this endeavor, argued that while these would look grand on a Cadillac, they
have no place in an airplane. &quot;Use standardized fonts!&quot; he said. He did have a point. If it was not me in the back hole, and
it was an emergency, readability, not style, is a prime factor. So, I had to remake them.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-11-23-switch-plates/boring-font.jpg" title="Plate with the boring font" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-11-23-switch-plates/boring-font-thumb.jpg" title="Plate with the boring font" alt="Plate with the boring font" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Plate with the boring font</p><p>Before actually committing to etching them, I wanted to do the final size and looks check with actual metal. So, I printed
the things on regular paper, spray glued that paper to some scrap aluminum, cut them out, and drilled the holes.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Right side</p><p>One thing became readily apparent - the lettering was too high up and rows were too close. Well, that was an easy fix on the model,
I just moved the bottom row a bit down.</p>
<p>The hour X was quick approaching. I now had the twice tested model that fits, and all the kinks were worked out.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="applying-the-final-mask">
<h2>Applying the Final Mask</h2>
<p>For material, I picked up a sheet of brushed &quot;Marine-Grade&quot; 464 .032&quot; thick brass from McMaster (remember this, &quot;brushed&quot; - one
side is brushed, the other is not).</p>
<p>On the final drawing for the mask, I replaced hole outlines with little &quot;donuts&quot; - thinking that those will make nice initial
&quot;center punch&quot; marks for the holes.</p>
<p>When printing it, the toner flaked off the transfer paper immediately. &quot;Bad sheet of paper&quot;, I thought. I also
found the &quot;Improve Toner Adhesion&quot; setting, and enabled it. That made a nice print-out.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">!??!??!?!?</p><p>What?! It worked before! A bunch of thoughts went rushing thru my head - more metal? Not getting it hot enough (but it was hot!)?
Bad toner? Wait!  YES! This time I used a completely new toner cartridge and new drum unit - to make sure my pattern has as little
of those pinholes as possible (remember, I ordered a new drum and toner after my initial test etch?)</p>
<p>I went home, and compared the serial numbers on the toner I had success with with the new toner. The first few letters were
different, as well as the few digits in the tail, which made me think it was a different brew of toner, and toner problem.
So, I printed the mask again with the toner that worked before.</p>
<p>I also
started thinking that the &quot;Improve Toner Adhesion&quot; setting I used might've caused mayhem. I <em>also</em> read a bit about that setting,
and it seems that Brother recommended using it if the toner flakes off <em>and</em> if setting the paper type properly (ie, &quot;plain&quot;,
&quot;card-stock&quot;, &quot;thick&quot;, etc) does <em>not</em> help. So to prevent flaking off, I set the paper thickness to &quot;thick&quot;, removed the
&quot;Improve Toner Adhesion&quot; setting, printed it again using the toner cartridge that worked before, and went back to the office...</p>

(the laminator I was using had a problem with feeding first 2-3 inches of brass - it wouldn't pick it up - so I used paper as the
&quot;carrier&quot;, which alleviated the problem). I thought that maybe paper was preventing some heat from being transferred well, and
got rid of it this time.</p>
<p>Same problem!</p>
<p>What the hell?</p>
<p>I took the laminator home, determined to run a bunch of tests (it was Sunday ;) ).</p>
<p>I had a couple of old masks left (I printed double the amount then, in case first try didn't work - so that would cover
the toner/drum combo that I know have worked). I printed a couple of new ones - new drum/old toner, and new drum/new toner.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-11-23-switch-plates/p-38.jpg" title="Test pieces" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-11-23-switch-plates/p-38-thumb.jpg" title="Test pieces" alt="Test pieces" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Test pieces</p><p>I also changed the settings again, for the two new prints I made.</p>
<p>As I mentioned before, when first printing the final mask (the one that didn't transfer), I had it's toner literally flake off
the paper in some spots. &quot;Hmm, I thought&quot;, and re-printed it, using the &quot;Improve Toner Adhesion&quot; setting enabled. That made the paper go thru
the printer much slower, it came out much hotter than usual, and the toner adhered well.</p>
<p>On the second try (the one that didn't transfer either), I read a bit about the &quot;Improve Toner Adhesion&quot; setting, and decided
to instead try to change the paper type to a more appropriate one - so blaming whatever &quot;Improve Toner Adhesion&quot; did for not
transferring of toner,
and blaming &quot;thick&quot; <em>not</em> being set on the first try causing toner to flake off, I set &quot;thick&quot; for paper type - which, again,
caused the same effect - slow feed, hot paper, good adhesion.</p>
<p>And then, when finally doing a systematic attempt to figure out what's wrong, I remembered that on the very first test masks
(the ones on the test piece of brass buss bar stock), I didn't tweak any paper settings at all.</p>
<p>&quot;Slow Feed&quot;, &quot;Hot&quot;, vs &quot;Fast Feed&quot;, &quot;Colder&quot;. This time, I started guessing that maybe, higher temp did something to the toner
that would then prevent it from being re-melted when fed thru the laminator. I decided to try my luck with &quot;plain&quot; paper type
(fast, cold feed), and count on my luck in the toner adhesion department.</p>
<p>I lucked out - test pieces came out fine, and, with three test masks, thru the laminator we went again.. And again... 10 times total, as before.</p>
<p>This time, things definitely changed! First of, all three transferred equally, but they transferred equally... crappy.</p>
<p>So, we knew that we were onto something with the feed/temp settings of the printer affected by the &quot;Improve Toner Adhesion&quot; and paper
thickness settings.</p>
<p>But, transfer was still crap.</p>
<p>And then, I realized one more thing.</p>
<p>I was transferring to the &quot;brushed&quot; (remember, I had a &quot;brushed&quot; brass sheet?) side of brass? Those &quot;brush marks&quot; are noticeably
deep when you drag your fingernail across them. I suspected that, effectively, whichever pieces of the mask were above the
marks, wouldn't touch any of the metal, and therefore won't stick.</p>
<p>OKay, but I can use the other side! It was cruddy, but a bit of the deburring wheel...</p>
<p>Wait. Go to the airport to polish the other side? Ugh.</p>
<p>Found a piece of steel wool we use to scrub dishes. Phew. That, under water, made the other side of brass nice and clean on
short order.</p>
<p>OK, the moment of truth. Printed the pattern again, using the new toner/drum, now, when we know that toner/drum aren't causing
my transfer problems, but rather, the temp and the feed rate of the printer are.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Transferred!</p><p>Phew. Okay. So, I guess, after all, Brother toner <em>is</em> finicky, just like the Fab-in-a-Box guys tell you, and mine is
not special. I don't know why fast feed / low temp would even keep it transferable.. but... Well, the lesson I take from this is
that I will be carefully considering the toner type when buying a new printer, when that time comes.</p>
<p>And then, the foil. I'll admit, I did a couple attempts with the foil. Yeah, and when I didn't like what happened on the first
attempt, I had to re-do the mask (toner transfer, that is) yet again!</p>
<p>My laminator has serious feed issues. The foil is very finicky, and keeping it straight requires laminator to feed nice, smooth,
even, and straight. My laminator needs to be &quot;helped&quot; sometimes with pressure pushing the plate &quot;in&quot;.</p>
<p>Oh, well. After the second attempt, I realized that I probably won't achieve ideal results on such a big piece, and instead,
used Sharpie to fix as much holes in the foil as I could find.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Final mask, and lots of Sharpie.</p><p>So, bottom line. If I want to make perfect, non-porous etches, I need to get me a good printer that will do what I need, and
a good laminator that actually feeds things nicely. Later, later :).</p>
<p>I was planning to etch the following morning.</p>

<h2>Paint</h2>
<p>I touched on the subject a bit already.</p>
<p>I was afraid of Rustoleum now, even learning that I messed it up myself with lacquer - it peeling off the base in sheets
didn't give me confidence. Rustoleum has clear enamel; but my reasoning was that if it peeled off <em>with</em> primer, clear enamel
without primer on relatively sharp edges of lettering will just come off almost immediately, given that my hands will always be
around the switches when operating them.</p>
<p>I settled on epoxy. It made sense. Klass Kote had good reviews from RC guys, and folks reported it brushable.</p>
<p>I completely stripped my old sample with brass wire brush and acetone. Wire brush cleaned it out nicely and smoothed
some roughness still left, so I wire brushed the new plates too. It helped, and seemingly worked better than the maroon
pad! Noted.</p>
<p>And then, I set up in the kitchen.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-11-23-switch-plates/p-59.jpg" title="Set up for painting." >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-11-23-switch-plates/p-59-thumb.jpg" title="Set up for painting." alt="Set up for painting." >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Set up for painting.</p><p>Klass Kote needs to be mixed, and reacted for at least 30 minutes prior to application. My plan (approved by Klass Kote) was to
do base in black, then bake it after initial flash off for 30 minutes at about 100 degrees <em>Celsius</em>. That will cure it enough to
make it sandable, after which I'd sand down the letters, and clear coat it. I won't need to bake the clear, 'cause I'm then done
for the night, and it can take it's sweet time curing.</p>
<p>Klass Kote is really thick when mixed!</p>
<p>Trying it straight on my test coupons left horrible brush marks.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Straight Klass Kote black</p><p>I tried it on my test plate as well - just to play with the baking process.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, mixed up a new batch and wanted to try it reduced with a lot of reducer to see if that would make it flow better.</p>
<p>Nope. That left the same brush marks, but just watered down, if you will. Multiple coats just made it uglier.</p>
<p>Hmm... Meanwhile, I had a batch of clear mixed too, and tried to see how the clear would look over my test plate that was now
baked and ready to be sanded down. Maybe, the brush marks would get better / a bit more hidden with extra brush marks of clear?</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">With light</p><p>See?</p>
<p>That's horrible.</p>
<p>Frustrated, I dumped my thinned batch of black into the tray I was using for garbage, and sat down thinking. My eye fell on a
foam brush I had in the set of brushes I bought. I mindlessly picked it up, and started smudging the dumped paint around the tray.</p>
<p>It flowed! Very nicely!</p>
<p>I then remembered how much I hate brushes in general. I was never able to get anything remotely approaching good with brushes.
When I built my kitchen cabs, I used cotton pads over foam brushes and achieved very smooth, mark-less results.</p>
<p>I think, this random act might've just worked!</p>
<p>I cleaned up my other, flat, coupon (the one that wasn't baked, so the epoxy would still come off with some wiping with the reducer).</p>
<p>I was now planning to mix the final batch of black I'd reduce. I'd try it on the coupon first, and then, if I liked the results,
on the actual pieces...</p>
<p>...it went on smooth, but fish-eyed a bit. I thought that that was due to some crud on the coupon (I wasn't cleaning the coupon
too good).</p>
<p>So, I put it on the actual plates.</p>
<p>It fisheyed! A lot of eyes flowed together, but some big ones stayed. I quickly dabbed them out with the corner of the brush with
some paint on it - too late, damn it! It didn't flow out. The whole thing was also rough-ish... thinned paint was flowing around
imperfections of the etched surface, as well as my dabs were messing with it, probably. There were also areas that had visible
marks of me lifting the brush.</p>
<p>At this point, I should've stopped, dunked it into the reducer, washed the whole thing off, and called it a nite.</p>
<p>But, I was too focused on getting there.</p>
<p>I thought, I might be able to get a uniform &quot;rough&quot; look.</p>
<p>Solvent was flashing off, and paint was getting thicker.</p>
<p>More paint, but this time gently, not to rub old paint off. Then, dab-dabbidy-dab the foam in and out.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">..on both</p><p>That looked acceptable, and I decided to let it  flash off the solvent. Meanwhile, went to Walmart for more foam brushes
(I only had two in the set).</p>
<p>Got back, mixed a batch of clear and left it off to react. It was looking good, with &quot;rough look&quot;, and I was thinking I might just be able to pull it off.</p>
<p>After the paint stopped being tacky, put the whole thing into my oven.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-11-23-switch-plates/p-200.jpg" title="What's for lunch, ma?" >

 </a> <p class="small text-center">What's for lunch, ma?</p><p>Yep, that's my toaster, repurposed as epoxy bake oven, and calibrated at 100 degrees Celsius :).</p>
<p>I forgot about solvent pop.</p>
<p>See, when you have too thick a layer of paint (which I did, when doing my &quot;rough look&quot; pass), and the top of it skins off,
some solvent might get trapped under it. What happens then is the trapped solvent  tries to evaporate, and can't: pressure builds, and it &quot;pops&quot;
the paint, making a tiny little pinhole.</p>
<p>So after 30 minutes, I pulled the plates out of the oven.  Yep, I got the pop a-plenty. Some areas of paint that were especially
thick got a ton of them.</p>
<p>I decided to stop <em>then</em>. Screw it. Rustoleum it is, as much as I hate the idea. This epoxy stuff is great (no, really, it is);
but I need to <em>spray</em> it.  So, I took a rag, wetted it with the solvent, and tried to rub the paint off.</p>
<p>Nope! It cured enough to no longer rub off with the reducer! Crap. Now, the only way to get it off is with Methylene Chloride
stripper... :(</p>
<p>Oh well. What's the best second option for a frustrated guy who failed at a paintjob at around 2 in the morning? Stop? Go to bed?
Strip and start anew?</p>
<p>Nope! I thought, &quot;well, I had a batch of clear right here. I can see if I can rub out the worst uglies with something, and try to
clear it to see if it'll hide the rest&quot;.</p>
<p>Admittedly, it did hide pretty neat.</p>
<p>I rubbed out the worst popped parts with maroon scotch brite, and sanded down the lettering.</p>

<p>Maybe, I will strip them and re-do the paint. Maybe not - that kind of light is unusual in a cockpit. Maybe I will file this under
the &quot;don't be an idiot / don't rush a paintjob / use the right tools&quot; section, and keep them as a reminder - until I have
to make another set.</p>
<p>I don't know. We'll see.</p>

   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-10-09-vr-mounted/vr-3-thumb.jpg" title="Tools!" alt="Tools!" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Tools!</p><p>Well. All those tools were participating in making of those holes, in sequence. Here's a game: name that sequence!</p>
<p>And then, the mounts. The regulator was to be on standoffs, to &quot;raise&quot; it above that rivet line.
The regulator wants two grounds, which will go under two of the standoffs. I also wanted to have a ground strap go under
a standoff.</p>
<p>Now, I have to explain the ground strap. I already mentioned spending quality time trying to make it.</p>
<p>I want to set up good grounding architecture in my all new electrical. This side conduit, to which the regulator is mounting, is key.</p>
<p>It's continuous, and aluminum - so it presents a really nice grounding point. I am planning to add jumpers between it and the
firewall, and it and the instrument panel, tying it all up nicely. Loads will be grounded to the conduit, firewall,
and instrument panel only.</p>
<p>Since the voltage regulator is right next to the firewall, it's very logical to have the ground strap under one of it's stands. And besides, there is already
a convenient hole right next to it for the firewall side of the grounding strap - which is why the strap is very short.</p>
<p>At any rate, those three terminals under three out of four standoffs for the regulator are making  hardware stacks of varying
thicknesses per standoff, so standoffs need to be individually sized to keep the regulator overall &quot;level&quot; above the conduit.</p>
<p>Another fly in the ointment is that &quot;jog&quot; created by one portion of the conduit riveted on top of another - that has to be
accounted for, too.</p>
<p>So four individual standoffs.</p>

didn't need to scrape the paint there).</p>
