<hr class="dashed"/><p>A couple things have been always on the back burner - fuse blocks, and finishing up the oil cooler bowden hookup.</p>
<p>In between waiting for completion of The Thing I Am Yet To Write About, finally, checked those off the list.</p>
<div class="section" id="fuse-blocks">
<h2>Fuse Blocks</h2>
<p>Location was figured out <a class="reference external" href="http://79ft.net/entries/2019-09-08-fwf-side-channel-panel-layouts/">a long time ago</a>, and I just
clamped them in place, center punched the holes, and drilled them.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Clamped in place for hole marking</p><p>One little bit was to figure out the exact fastener lengths and washer stacks, because the right one had it's right (forward most) end riding
on top of a reasonably thick aluminum placard you will see much better in the following picture.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Fuse blocks: mounted</p><p>Done! Done?</p>
<p>You are forgetting, my Dear Reader. We here are in the <em>misery</em> business. Look carefully at the curvature of the fuselage. Imagine the
side panel, open on the pictures, closed over our &quot;conduit&quot;, on which the fuse blocks are installed. Do you see how the available &quot;depth&quot;
will be bigger in the middle of the conduit as compared to the top?</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>Of course, the panel won't close. With fuses installed, they would rub on the side panel. Not Good.</p>
<p>But relocating them down? What's the problem? Bowden cables, of course! I'd be too close to them, and I wanted very much to isolate my
wire bundle and my bowdens; but even if I didn't, I still won't have enough room there for a terminal, and a nice 90 degree &quot;turn&quot; for the
wire to go sideways (either towards the panel, or towards the firewall).</p>
<p>Solution?</p>
<p>Well.. there weren't any good ones, so I ended up taking the best of the crappy ones.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Final fuseblock mount locations</p><p>Not ideal, because they're flipped over - so <em>technically</em>, condensation can run down and into the fuse socket. Not a good situation to be
in, but I can't do anything here. I guess, inspecting this area for corrosion is going to be on my Regular Maintenance List.</p>
<p>Oh, and I ended up with four <em>extra</em> perfectly drilled and deburred holes, right in the passenger's cockpit. That's what is on the other side
of that &quot;conduit&quot;.</p>
<p>I guess, I will attach a placard to them stating that those are &quot;hole samples&quot; or something (my friend Dick Gossen placarded a missing screw in his instrument panel once,
so I figure I am allowed as well).</p>

<h2>Oil Cooler Bowden</h2>
<p>When <a class="reference external" href="http://79ft.net/entries/2019-09-08-fwf-side-channel-panel-layouts/">headscratching about</a>, and later
<a class="reference external" href="http://79ft.net/entries/2019-10-09-vr-mounted/">installing the voltage regulator</a>, Oil Cooler Air Shutoff Valve bowden was relocated
(and because of that, I had to use a longer Bowden, which, gladly, I had an extra of after removing the Rotec's Throttle Body Injector).</p>
<p>All that was left was cut it to size, and install it into the valve's pivot arm.</p>
<p>Cutting bowdens? I don't know, I think it's easy. Pull out the actual control wire, and use bolt cutters. Push the wire back in, and trim
to desired length.</p>
<p>Done.</p>
<p>Here's the pivot arm.</p>

<p>The other minor problem? The hole that clamps the &quot;eye&quot; that holds the bowden's outer housing in place was drilled too close to the place
where the eye begins. Result? Flat washer was too big to lay flat.</p>

<hr class="dashed"/><p>While waiting for someone else to get back to me to help me finish &lt;the thing that took last month and a half
and  is yet to be written about&gt;, I decided to work on the panel a bit.</p>
<p>Lighting strip seemed like a nice place to start.</p>
<p>It's a simple LED strip that I planned to glue right behind coaming on the underside of the eyebrow. This way, it'd be
invisible from pretty much any angle.</p>
<p>But, the wires! The wires in <em>front</em> of the panel, that have to go to the behinds.. No worries I thought, I'd make  a small
hole / slit in the top of the panel, also invisible - and fish the wires thru there.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2020-01-29-light-and-compass/lc-1.jpg" title="The Plan" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2020-01-29-light-and-compass/lc-1-thumb.jpg" title="The Plan" alt="The Plan" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">The Plan</p><p>That was the plan.</p>
<p>Reality, of course, decided to disagree.</p>
<p>The plan was to take out all the screws that went around the top of the panel, and tilt it &quot;down&quot; - so that I
could use a drill comfortably to make the little slit for the wires.</p>
<p>Couple screws came out nice.</p>
<p>I think the third one came out like...</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2020-01-29-light-and-compass/lc-2.jpg" title="?!" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2020-01-29-light-and-compass/lc-2-thumb.jpg" title="?!" alt="?!" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">?!</p><p>Did I just bust a screw? I looked into the hole. <em>Empty?!</em></p>
<p>Upon further examination, I found... glue? What? The screw head was... glued into the hole? That's a first.</p>
<p>After taking the rest of the screws out, I realized what happened.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2020-01-29-light-and-compass/lc-3.jpg" title="Backside of the panel" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2020-01-29-light-and-compass/lc-3-thumb.jpg" title="Backside of the panel" alt="Backside of the panel" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Backside of the panel</p><p>This is the back side of the panel. The panel is attached thru those little tabs and nutplates.</p>
<p>Notice the nutplates using rigid (not floating) style nuts? A slight misdrilling of the holes in the panel, and screws
won't go in at all.</p>
<p>So, there were two &quot;screws&quot; that were just heads glued in - yep - and two more that used #6 screw in a #8 nut - the TPI on those is the same, and the holes were drilled sufficiently close enough to let a #6 screw pass thru; but not a #8. Le.. Sigh.</p>
<p>To top it all off, the panel won't fold down for me to get access to where I wanted to be, and to fish it out I'd have to take
out the carb heat bowden cable that was attached to it. Too much trouble if I can avoid it (that carb heat cable would've
been a 3-4 hour affair just by itself).</p>
<p>Plan B solidified; but first the panel had to be put back.</p>
<p>I ended up putting #6 screws into all the misdrilled holes (sorry, but glueing heads into holes is.. not my thing :)); but I installed nuts on them on the back. Effectively, set up like this the nutplates don't do anything - just add weight. See
the picture above - it has the nut over that nutplate. That nut, by the way, was a pain to get in - see how close another nut is to it?</p>
<p>I think all the fiddling with the panel, screws, nuts, washers (losing a few of them and going on fishing expedition
to pull them out of the guts of the plane included, of course), and trying to get it back in right took what.. around 6 hours?</p>
<p>The plan B, now executable after the panel was back in, was to route the wire under the eyebrow, and fish it thru behind
the coaming to the &quot;top&quot; side right in the middle, where the compass was to be. It then would join the compass light
wire, and go to behind the panel land.</p>
<p>So, the strip was glued, and the wire attached to under the eyebrow with <em>HVAC duct sealing tape</em>, ahem, aircraft grade
glue backed aluminum sheeting from the local friendly Aerospace Depot.</p>

<hr class="dashed"/><p>This is all your fault, you know who!</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Way back, when working on the new layout for switches on the panel, I was thinking about how to re-label them.</p>
<p>I had a nice Brady label maker, and was thinking about just printing and sticking some tags over existing, painted, lettering,
on the switch placards.</p>
<p>One of the nights, when I was tired enough to do anything useful, I was playing with the stickers, and posted this picture
here:</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-11-23-switch-plates/p-100.jpg" title="Playing with placards" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-11-23-switch-plates/p-100-thumb.jpg" title="Playing with placards" alt="Playing with placards" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Playing with placards</p><p>The you-know-who-you-are, of course, wasn't happy (this gentleman is an actual friend of mine, not a silly voice in my head).
&quot;They will fall off&quot;, he said. &quot;Can't you do something a bit more professional&quot;? &quot;Can't you draw them up, and order them to be custom made&quot;?</p>
<p>Order?</p>
<p>Ha!</p>
<p>No. This whole exercise in airplane handling is to put yourself thru as much misery as possible. So the placards had to be
made, not ordered. I mean, I could've ordered my electrical redone too, right? :)</p>
<p>I recalled that I read somewhere on Vintage Machinery that someone figured out a neat way to restore old
data plates on old lathes and such. Looking it up, I remembered.</p>
<p>Etching!</p>
<p>The idea is basic - make a mask, transfer it to a piece of metal, soak it in acid, paint, sand - your recessed (etched) areas will
keep paint, while the elevated (masked out) areas will sand out. This way, you get metal-on-paint look, and it's nice and
pretty.</p>
<p>So, it has been decided - I will etch out my switch placards!</p>
<p>First, though, I had to figure out...</p>
<div class="section" id="the-process">
<h2>The Process</h2>
<p>Obviously, SolidWorks would be instrumental in making the actual pattern. I wanted to make the placards out of brass, so that
lettering would be yellow, and I'd paint them black, for the yellow on black final result.</p>
<p>First, the mask.</p>
<p>Searching around, it seemed that the most reasonable way to go about it would be to use Toner Transfer technique. Laser printer
toner (at least on a good subset of laser printers) is basically powdered plastic. Printer warms it up, which makes it sticky -
and toner then fuses itself to
paper. It can be re-softened (and made sticky again) by a normal household iron or a laminator. I had both - an iron, obviously;
but we also had a great &quot;office grade&quot; laminator in the office.</p>
<p>A lot of folks had success with glossy paper (glossy paper doesn't absorb melted toner, it sticks, but stays on top), but I, looking
around, found a lot of good reviews of the <a class="reference external" href="https://pcbfx.com">PCB Fab in a Box</a> system.</p>
<p>Not only the guy makes a very nice toner transfer paper which &quot;releases&quot; the toner when soaked in water (it works just like your
model decals in plastic models, you soak the paper, and the top layer comes off), he also seems to have researched and cleaned up
the process to minutia. For example, the toner itself is porous (indeed!) so he uses an extra layer of plastic to &quot;fuse&quot; the
micro-gaps between toner granulas as transferred  with another layer called &quot;TRF Foil&quot;. He also did a lot of research into
printers, toners, application techniques and such - and published a great handbook. Just for that alone, I wanted him to have my
money.</p>
<p>So, I ordered the transfer paper (the one you print your mask on), and tried the first step - transferring it to a small strip of
brass in a laminator.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-11-23-switch-plates/p-1.jpg" title="Laminator with envelope with the workpiece" >

   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-11-23-switch-plates/p-2-thumb.jpg" title="Transferred!" alt="Transferred!" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Transferred!</p><p>What's wrong with that picture? Riiight! I forgot to mirror the pattern :). Damn.</p>
<p>I messed around quite a bit with density, too. Just default settings were crap, obviously. Bumping up the density to max didn't help
much. I installed a new toner cartridge, and that improved the density dramatically - while not perfect, it would've been workable,
hopefully, with the addition of the TRF foil (and, if I saw any obvious holes, I could fill them with a sharpie).</p>
<p>Okay. But the basic test worked! The pattern transferred nicely.</p>
<p>Second time, I threw together another test mask with a couple of different fonts about the size I'd want on the placards -
I was gonna transfer those to a small chunk of brass bar stock, and try etching.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-11-23-switch-plates/p-5.jpg" title="Second pattern" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-11-23-switch-plates/p-5-thumb.jpg" title="Second pattern" alt="Second pattern" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Second pattern</p><p>With the help of child labor, patterns were cut out, and transferred successfully to the brass bar stock.
I then applied the green TRF foil (that stuff that fuses the pores between toner's grains) to it.</p>
<p>Side note: the process manual from <a class="reference external" href="https://pcbfx.com">PCB Fab in a Box</a> notes explicitly that Brother printers have a kind
of toner that requires much higher than usual laminator's temps to melt. I have a Brother printer, but  since I was able to do
my first transfer successfully, I kinda decided to not bother - it worked, so I must be the lucky one right? Though I admit, I did entertain an idea of a new
printer... ;)</p>
<p>On one of the evenings, I had a block of a few hours, and the weather was nice. I had all my chemicals (ferric chloride PCB
etching solution and boxes of baking soda to neutralize it afterwards), so I decided to try the actual etching process.</p>
<p>I hooked up the test plate to a piece of closed cell foam (to float it on top of acid)...</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-11-23-switch-plates/p-8.jpg" title="Brass with mask hooked up" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-11-23-switch-plates/p-8-thumb.jpg" title="Brass with mask hooked up" alt="Brass with mask hooked up" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Brass with mask hooked up</p><p>...set up a small plastic table outside the hangar...</p>

   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-11-23-switch-plates/p-7-thumb.jpg" title="The setup" alt="The setup" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">The setup</p><p>...and went to town.</p>
<p>The idea was to try to get the ferric chloride to about 100 degrees F to speed up the process, so I did a hot water tub (hence, the
little camp stove in my setup).</p>
<p>I'd have a large tub with hot water, and a small tub with etching solution in it, with the workpiece floating on top, hooked up to
the foam.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-11-23-switch-plates/p-9.jpg" title="Etch, etch away!" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-11-23-switch-plates/p-9-thumb.jpg" title="Etch, etch away!" alt="Etch, etch away!" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Etch, etch away!</p><p>It took about 40-50 minutes, I think, till I was comfortable with the depth of etching. Every 10ish minutes I'd pull the piece out,
and brush it with etchant to clear the debris that, I thought, would collect in small nooks and crannies (I saw a guy do that on
one of the videos I watched).</p>
<p>After a decent etching depth was achieved, I pulled it out, and dunked it in soda to neutralize the acid.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-11-23-switch-plates/p-10.jpg" title="Neutralizing" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-11-23-switch-plates/p-10-thumb.jpg" title="Neutralizing" alt="Neutralizing" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Neutralizing</p><p>Then, lots of rinsing, while catching water into a tub. Acid, even neutralized, will contain dissolved copper, and just dumping
it is not good. I was planning to keep the tub and let water evaporate, at which point I could just wipe off the powdery residue.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-11-23-switch-plates/p-11.jpg" title="All cleaned up" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-11-23-switch-plates/p-11-thumb.jpg" title="All cleaned up" alt="All cleaned up" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">All cleaned up</p><p>After that, a rag with acetone wipes off the mask, and...</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-11-23-switch-plates/p-12.jpg" title="Etched!" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-11-23-switch-plates/p-12-thumb.jpg" title="Etched!" alt="Etched!" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Etched!</p><p>The edges on the letters (basically, the edges of the mask) are very rough there. On these test ones, I started with a maroon
pad, but quickly went to a 120 grit non-woven deburring wheel, which cleaned it up nice (and of course, messed up the letters -
well, lesson learned, I won't use that aggressive a method on the real thing).</p>
<p>Later, when painting, I noticed that the mask was still porous, letting some acid in (I had some tiny &quot;cavities&quot; in random spots).
It looked pretty good when applied.  This would become obvious later, when I started adding color. I suspected the old drum, and decided to get a
new drum for the printer - though in hindsight, I think this is, after all, the problem of me having the Brother printer
(read on ;) ). Meanwhile, I ordered a new drum and a new cartridge.</p>
<p>And then, the paint.</p>
<p>I wanted &quot;golden&quot; letters on &quot;black&quot; background. I wanted to make the whole piece black, and then sand it on a flat surface -
everything that was masked would have the black sanded off, and the rest would keep it, achieving the effect.</p>
<p>I wanted to try a couple different &quot;make it black&quot; approaches. One would be forced oxidation with something like a gun blueing
acid, and the other would be plain paint. I had two test areas, which would allow be to try both at the same time.</p>
<p>So I blued one side....</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Blued with Brownell Oxpho-Blue</p><p>... and sanded it down.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Sanded down</p><p>Couple notes on blueing. I tried Brownells Oxpho-Blue, and then later Birchwood Casey Brass Black. Both produce a layer of black
oxide on the brass. There are a couple of problems, though.</p>
<p>First of, the etched surface is not perfect - and those imperfections are not really hidden by oxidizing, obviously. Second,
and bigger, problem, is that that oxide is powdery, and can be rubbed off easily with even a paper towel, given enough elbow
grease. I was afraid I'd have adhesion problems with the top coat (I was gonna coat the whole thing in clear to prevent tarnishing
of letters), so I decided against it.</p>
<p>The other side I decided to put just your basic schedule of Rustoleum - primer, and flat black.</p>

   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-11-23-switch-plates/p-23-thumb.jpg" title="Rustoleum sanded down" alt="Rustoleum sanded down" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Rustoleum sanded down</p><p>I liked that side much better. However, the primer, being white, would show in between the paint and the letters, being noticeable.
I decided to find some black primer - and meanwhile, coated the whole thing in lacquer, which I decided to use as a top coat.</p>
<p>Mistake! A few weeks later, lacquer started flaking off. Yeah, I learned the &quot;no lacquer on top of  enamel&quot; rule. But it was
flaking off on plain brass too, so.. lacquer was no way to go.</p>
<p>Just typing that, in hindsight, maybe there was some acid residue after blueing... but acid was dried, and I
used acetone to clean up the blued side. But again, clear brass had lacquer coming off as well.</p>
<p>Worse part is, the enamel lifted and was coming off in pieces.</p>
<p>So instead, I did something that in hindsight I think was a mistake. I decided to look for a better paint solution,
and very quickly arrived at epoxy, specifically, <a class="reference external" href="www.klasskote.com">Klass Kote</a>. It seems to be used by a lot of RC builders
very successfully, I saw successful reports of brushing it, and talked to them, too. I was sold. Again, in hindsight... I think
this was a mistake. But, read on. :)</p>

<div class="section" id="the-actual-mask">
<h2>The Actual Mask</h2>
<p>To make the actual mask for the actual plates, I used my
<a class="reference external" href="http://79ft.net/entries/2019-08-31-alternator-pivot-arm/">scan-and-draw-around-it</a> Solidworks trick. I scanned the old placards,
and sketched around them.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-11-23-switch-plates/swx-sketch.jpg" title="Sketch" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-11-23-switch-plates/swx-sketch-thumb.jpg" title="Sketch" alt="Sketch" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Sketch</p><p>I very quickly discovered that on one of them, the sides were not parallel; and the holes were all not on one line, and not
evenly spaced! :). So, I made two versions - one all nice and even, and the other just like the old placards.</p>
<p>Using a bit of cardstock, I tried each of them on to make sure the holes are okay and such...</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-11-23-switch-plates/p-20.jpg" title="Trying on the pattern" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-11-23-switch-plates/p-20-thumb.jpg" title="Trying on the pattern" alt="Trying on the pattern" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Trying on the pattern</p><p>Guess which ones fit better? Yep, the crooked ones! Straightening them out made holes not line up with holes in the panel, and one
of them would interfere with some screws on the panel. Oh well.</p>
<p>Then, came quite some hours (that I didn't log to be honest) fiddling with the font and the layout. I decided to use &quot;Magneto&quot;,
the kick ass italic font out of the four I tried on my test etch.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-11-23-switch-plates/cool-font.jpg" title="Plates with the cool font" >

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Plates with the cool font</p><p>But, the same gentleman who made me undertake this endeavor, argued that while these would look grand on a Cadillac, they
have no place in an airplane. &quot;Use standardized fonts!&quot; he said. He did have a point. If it was not me in the back hole, and
it was an emergency, readability, not style, is a prime factor. So, I had to remake them.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Plate with the boring font</p><p>Before actually committing to etching them, I wanted to do the final size and looks check with actual metal. So, I printed
the things on regular paper, spray glued that paper to some scrap aluminum, cut them out, and drilled the holes.</p>

I just moved the bottom row a bit down.</p>
<p>The hour X was quick approaching. I now had the twice tested model that fits, and all the kinks were worked out.</p>

<div class="section" id="applying-the-final-mask">
<h2>Applying the Final Mask</h2>
<p>For material, I picked up a sheet of brushed &quot;Marine-Grade&quot; 464 .032&quot; thick brass from McMaster (remember this, &quot;brushed&quot; - one
side is brushed, the other is not).</p>
<p>On the final drawing for the mask, I replaced hole outlines with little &quot;donuts&quot; - thinking that those will make nice initial
&quot;center punch&quot; marks for the holes.</p>
<p>When printing it, the toner flaked off the transfer paper immediately. &quot;Bad sheet of paper&quot;, I thought. I also
found the &quot;Improve Toner Adhesion&quot; setting, and enabled it. That made a nice print-out.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">!??!??!?!?</p><p>What?! It worked before! A bunch of thoughts went rushing thru my head - more metal? Not getting it hot enough (but it was hot!)?
Bad toner? Wait!  YES! This time I used a completely new toner cartridge and new drum unit - to make sure my pattern has as little
of those pinholes as possible (remember, I ordered a new drum and toner after my initial test etch?)</p>
<p>I went home, and compared the serial numbers on the toner I had success with with the new toner. The first few letters were
different, as well as the few digits in the tail, which made me think it was a different brew of toner, and toner problem.
So, I printed the mask again with the toner that worked before.</p>
<p>I also
started thinking that the &quot;Improve Toner Adhesion&quot; setting I used might've caused mayhem. I <em>also</em> read a bit about that setting,
and it seems that Brother recommended using it if the toner flakes off <em>and</em> if setting the paper type properly (ie, &quot;plain&quot;,
&quot;card-stock&quot;, &quot;thick&quot;, etc) does <em>not</em> help. So to prevent flaking off, I set the paper thickness to &quot;thick&quot;, removed the
&quot;Improve Toner Adhesion&quot; setting, printed it again using the toner cartridge that worked before, and went back to the office...</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-11-23-switch-plates/p-35.jpg" title="Second attempt" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-11-23-switch-plates/p-35-thumb.jpg" title="Second attempt" alt="Second attempt" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Second attempt</p><p>This time I didn't use the &quot;pouch&quot; of paper I typically wrapped around to protect the brass and help the laminator pull it thru
(the laminator I was using had a problem with feeding first 2-3 inches of brass - it wouldn't pick it up - so I used paper as the
&quot;carrier&quot;, which alleviated the problem). I thought that maybe paper was preventing some heat from being transferred well, and
got rid of it this time.</p>
<p>Same problem!</p>
<p>What the hell?</p>
<p>I took the laminator home, determined to run a bunch of tests (it was Sunday ;) ).</p>
<p>I had a couple of old masks left (I printed double the amount then, in case first try didn't work - so that would cover
the toner/drum combo that I know have worked). I printed a couple of new ones - new drum/old toner, and new drum/new toner.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-11-23-switch-plates/p-38.jpg" title="Test pieces" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-11-23-switch-plates/p-38-thumb.jpg" title="Test pieces" alt="Test pieces" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Test pieces</p><p>I also changed the settings again, for the two new prints I made.</p>
<p>As I mentioned before, when first printing the final mask (the one that didn't transfer), I had it's toner literally flake off
the paper in some spots. &quot;Hmm, I thought&quot;, and re-printed it, using the &quot;Improve Toner Adhesion&quot; setting enabled. That made the paper go thru
the printer much slower, it came out much hotter than usual, and the toner adhered well.</p>
<p>On the second try (the one that didn't transfer either), I read a bit about the &quot;Improve Toner Adhesion&quot; setting, and decided
to instead try to change the paper type to a more appropriate one - so blaming whatever &quot;Improve Toner Adhesion&quot; did for not
transferring of toner,
and blaming &quot;thick&quot; <em>not</em> being set on the first try causing toner to flake off, I set &quot;thick&quot; for paper type - which, again,
caused the same effect - slow feed, hot paper, good adhesion.</p>
<p>And then, when finally doing a systematic attempt to figure out what's wrong, I remembered that on the very first test masks
(the ones on the test piece of brass buss bar stock), I didn't tweak any paper settings at all.</p>
<p>&quot;Slow Feed&quot;, &quot;Hot&quot;, vs &quot;Fast Feed&quot;, &quot;Colder&quot;. This time, I started guessing that maybe, higher temp did something to the toner
that would then prevent it from being re-melted when fed thru the laminator. I decided to try my luck with &quot;plain&quot; paper type
(fast, cold feed), and count on my luck in the toner adhesion department.</p>
<p>I lucked out - test pieces came out fine, and, with three test masks, thru the laminator we went again.. And again... 10 times total, as before.</p>
<p>This time, things definitely changed! First of, all three transferred equally, but they transferred equally... crappy.</p>
<p>So, we knew that we were onto something with the feed/temp settings of the printer affected by the &quot;Improve Toner Adhesion&quot; and paper
thickness settings.</p>
<p>But, transfer was still crap.</p>
<p>And then, I realized one more thing.</p>
<p>I was transferring to the &quot;brushed&quot; (remember, I had a &quot;brushed&quot; brass sheet?) side of brass? Those &quot;brush marks&quot; are noticeably
deep when you drag your fingernail across them. I suspected that, effectively, whichever pieces of the mask were above the
marks, wouldn't touch any of the metal, and therefore won't stick.</p>
<p>OKay, but I can use the other side! It was cruddy, but a bit of the deburring wheel...</p>
<p>Wait. Go to the airport to polish the other side? Ugh.</p>
<p>Found a piece of steel wool we use to scrub dishes. Phew. That, under water, made the other side of brass nice and clean on
short order.</p>
<p>OK, the moment of truth. Printed the pattern again, using the new toner/drum, now, when we know that toner/drum aren't causing
my transfer problems, but rather, the temp and the feed rate of the printer are.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Transferred!</p><p>Phew. Okay. So, I guess, after all, Brother toner <em>is</em> finicky, just like the Fab-in-a-Box guys tell you, and mine is
not special. I don't know why fast feed / low temp would even keep it transferable.. but... Well, the lesson I take from this is
that I will be carefully considering the toner type when buying a new printer, when that time comes.</p>
<p>And then, the foil. I'll admit, I did a couple attempts with the foil. Yeah, and when I didn't like what happened on the first
attempt, I had to re-do the mask (toner transfer, that is) yet again!</p>
<p>My laminator has serious feed issues. The foil is very finicky, and keeping it straight requires laminator to feed nice, smooth,
even, and straight. My laminator needs to be &quot;helped&quot; sometimes with pressure pushing the plate &quot;in&quot;.</p>
<p>Oh, well. After the second attempt, I realized that I probably won't achieve ideal results on such a big piece, and instead,
used Sharpie to fix as much holes in the foil as I could find.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Final mask, and lots of Sharpie.</p><p>So, bottom line. If I want to make perfect, non-porous etches, I need to get me a good printer that will do what I need, and
a good laminator that actually feeds things nicely. Later, later :).</p>
<p>I was planning to etch the following morning.</p>

<h2>Paint</h2>
<p>I touched on the subject a bit already.</p>
<p>I was afraid of Rustoleum now, even learning that I messed it up myself with lacquer - it peeling off the base in sheets
didn't give me confidence. Rustoleum has clear enamel; but my reasoning was that if it peeled off <em>with</em> primer, clear enamel
without primer on relatively sharp edges of lettering will just come off almost immediately, given that my hands will always be
around the switches when operating them.</p>
<p>I settled on epoxy. It made sense. Klass Kote had good reviews from RC guys, and folks reported it brushable.</p>
<p>I completely stripped my old sample with brass wire brush and acetone. Wire brush cleaned it out nicely and smoothed
some roughness still left, so I wire brushed the new plates too. It helped, and seemingly worked better than the maroon
pad! Noted.</p>
<p>And then, I set up in the kitchen.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Set up for painting.</p><p>Klass Kote needs to be mixed, and reacted for at least 30 minutes prior to application. My plan (approved by Klass Kote) was to
do base in black, then bake it after initial flash off for 30 minutes at about 100 degrees <em>Celsius</em>. That will cure it enough to
make it sandable, after which I'd sand down the letters, and clear coat it. I won't need to bake the clear, 'cause I'm then done
for the night, and it can take it's sweet time curing.</p>
<p>Klass Kote is really thick when mixed!</p>
<p>Trying it straight on my test coupons left horrible brush marks.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Straight Klass Kote black</p><p>I tried it on my test plate as well - just to play with the baking process.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, mixed up a new batch and wanted to try it reduced with a lot of reducer to see if that would make it flow better.</p>
<p>Nope. That left the same brush marks, but just watered down, if you will. Multiple coats just made it uglier.</p>
<p>Hmm... Meanwhile, I had a batch of clear mixed too, and tried to see how the clear would look over my test plate that was now
baked and ready to be sanded down. Maybe, the brush marks would get better / a bit more hidden with extra brush marks of clear?</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">With light</p><p>See?</p>
<p>That's horrible.</p>
<p>Frustrated, I dumped my thinned batch of black into the tray I was using for garbage, and sat down thinking. My eye fell on a
foam brush I had in the set of brushes I bought. I mindlessly picked it up, and started smudging the dumped paint around the tray.</p>
<p>It flowed! Very nicely!</p>
<p>I then remembered how much I hate brushes in general. I was never able to get anything remotely approaching good with brushes.
When I built my kitchen cabs, I used cotton pads over foam brushes and achieved very smooth, mark-less results.</p>
<p>I think, this random act might've just worked!</p>
<p>I cleaned up my other, flat, coupon (the one that wasn't baked, so the epoxy would still come off with some wiping with the reducer).</p>
<p>I was now planning to mix the final batch of black I'd reduce. I'd try it on the coupon first, and then, if I liked the results,
on the actual pieces...</p>
<p>...it went on smooth, but fish-eyed a bit. I thought that that was due to some crud on the coupon (I wasn't cleaning the coupon
too good).</p>
<p>So, I put it on the actual plates.</p>
<p>It fisheyed! A lot of eyes flowed together, but some big ones stayed. I quickly dabbed them out with the corner of the brush with
some paint on it - too late, damn it! It didn't flow out. The whole thing was also rough-ish... thinned paint was flowing around
imperfections of the etched surface, as well as my dabs were messing with it, probably. There were also areas that had visible
marks of me lifting the brush.</p>
<p>At this point, I should've stopped, dunked it into the reducer, washed the whole thing off, and called it a nite.</p>
<p>But, I was too focused on getting there.</p>
<p>I thought, I might be able to get a uniform &quot;rough&quot; look.</p>
<p>Solvent was flashing off, and paint was getting thicker.</p>
<p>More paint, but this time gently, not to rub old paint off. Then, dab-dabbidy-dab the foam in and out.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">..on both</p><p>That looked acceptable, and I decided to let it  flash off the solvent. Meanwhile, went to Walmart for more foam brushes
(I only had two in the set).</p>
<p>Got back, mixed a batch of clear and left it off to react. It was looking good, with &quot;rough look&quot;, and I was thinking I might just be able to pull it off.</p>
<p>After the paint stopped being tacky, put the whole thing into my oven.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">What's for lunch, ma?</p><p>Yep, that's my toaster, repurposed as epoxy bake oven, and calibrated at 100 degrees Celsius :).</p>
<p>I forgot about solvent pop.</p>
<p>See, when you have too thick a layer of paint (which I did, when doing my &quot;rough look&quot; pass), and the top of it skins off,
some solvent might get trapped under it. What happens then is the trapped solvent  tries to evaporate, and can't: pressure builds, and it &quot;pops&quot;
the paint, making a tiny little pinhole.</p>
<p>So after 30 minutes, I pulled the plates out of the oven.  Yep, I got the pop a-plenty. Some areas of paint that were especially
thick got a ton of them.</p>
<p>I decided to stop <em>then</em>. Screw it. Rustoleum it is, as much as I hate the idea. This epoxy stuff is great (no, really, it is);
but I need to <em>spray</em> it.  So, I took a rag, wetted it with the solvent, and tried to rub the paint off.</p>
<p>Nope! It cured enough to no longer rub off with the reducer! Crap. Now, the only way to get it off is with Methylene Chloride
stripper... :(</p>
<p>Oh well. What's the best second option for a frustrated guy who failed at a paintjob at around 2 in the morning? Stop? Go to bed?
Strip and start anew?</p>
<p>Nope! I thought, &quot;well, I had a batch of clear right here. I can see if I can rub out the worst uglies with something, and try to
clear it to see if it'll hide the rest&quot;.</p>
<p>Admittedly, it did hide pretty neat.</p>
<p>I rubbed out the worst popped parts with maroon scotch brite, and sanded down the lettering.</p>

<p>Maybe, I will strip them and re-do the paint. Maybe not - that kind of light is unusual in a cockpit. Maybe I will file this under
the &quot;don't be an idiot / don't rush a paintjob / use the right tools&quot; section, and keep them as a reminder - until I have
to make another set.</p>
<p>I don't know. We'll see.</p>

<hr class="dashed"/><p>Prior to mounting the <a class="reference external" href="http://79ft.net/entries/2019-09-30-brake-line/">newly finished brake line</a>, I wanted to finish
fastening everything that's around it - so that I minimize wrenching around the brand new line.</p>
<p>Voltage Regulator is one of the bits that will go right there, so it was to be done.</p>
<p>I was working on it's mounting, on and off, and eventually got stuck with <a class="reference external" href="http://79ft.net/entries/2019-10-08-good-crimps/">attempting to solder a short grounding
strap</a> that was to go under one of the &quot;standoffs&quot; for the regulator.</p>
<p>And then, I was making the new brake line - but now that is done too. I also figured out how
to make that ground strap. So. nothing prevented me from completing the voltage regulator install.</p>
<p>But, we're getting ahead of ourselves.</p>
<p>First, the holes.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-10-09-vr-mounted/vr-2.jpg" title="Holes" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-10-09-vr-mounted/vr-2-thumb.jpg" title="Holes" alt="Holes" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Holes</p><p>How do you drill real good, round, quality holes, you ask?</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-10-09-vr-mounted/vr-3.jpg" title="Tools!" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-10-09-vr-mounted/vr-3-thumb.jpg" title="Tools!" alt="Tools!" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Tools!</p><p>Well. All those tools were participating in making of those holes, in sequence. Here's a game: name that sequence!</p>
<p>And then, the mounts. The regulator was to be on standoffs, to &quot;raise&quot; it above that rivet line.
The regulator wants two grounds, which will go under two of the standoffs. I also wanted to have a ground strap go under
a standoff.</p>
<p>Now, I have to explain the ground strap. I already mentioned spending quality time trying to make it.</p>
<p>I want to set up good grounding architecture in my all new electrical. This side conduit, to which the regulator is mounting, is key.</p>
<p>It's continuous, and aluminum - so it presents a really nice grounding point. I am planning to add jumpers between it and the
firewall, and it and the instrument panel, tying it all up nicely. Loads will be grounded to the conduit, firewall,
and instrument panel only.</p>
<p>Since the voltage regulator is right next to the firewall, it's very logical to have the ground strap under one of it's stands. And besides, there is already
a convenient hole right next to it for the firewall side of the grounding strap - which is why the strap is very short.</p>
<p>At any rate, those three terminals under three out of four standoffs for the regulator are making  hardware stacks of varying
thicknesses per standoff, so standoffs need to be individually sized to keep the regulator overall &quot;level&quot; above the conduit.</p>
<p>Another fly in the ointment is that &quot;jog&quot; created by one portion of the conduit riveted on top of another - that has to be
accounted for, too.</p>
<p>So four individual standoffs.</p>

<hr class="dashed"/><p>A while back, I wrote a
<a class="reference external" href="http://79ft.net/entries/2019-09-07-hf-crimper/">note on my failures at getting good crimps with the hydraulic crimper I had</a>.</p>
<p>My conclusion then was, &quot;solder&quot;.</p>
<p>Well, I tried :). I had to make a little bonding strap, maybe 5 inches long.</p>
<p>First time, I cowboyed it - just stuck the strap into the terminal, and soldered away.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Back side</p><p>My main problem was, I was trying to prevent solder wicking as much as I could. And I couldn't.
It would make 1 inch or more of the wire perceivably &quot;crusty&quot;, and I still won't have the barrel
filled in. Remember, I was trying to make a small, short grounding strap, that had to be flexible
to bend almost 180 degrees. I was trying to achieve a &quot;crimp quality&quot; break between solid metal
and strands, and could not.</p>
<p>When I started thinking about it like that, I realized that what I'm trying to do is likely impossible.</p>
<p>Solder will wick - you can control how much with technique and practice, but you can't prevent it.
So my current thinking is, if you solder your large lugs, be ready to support first few inches
of wire really well, so that that &quot;crusty&quot; portion of it doesn't move.</p>
<p>So, I tried to Hail Mary the crimps again. Previously, I had them just damn ugly (I linked the
article above).</p>
<p>I got a small anvil tool (the kind you insert the barrel of the terminal and whack a pin with a
hammer) from Spruce. Thought, 25 bucks was worth a try.</p>
<p>Those crimps were even uglier. I don't know what I expected - I guess that was an act of desperation?
I didn't even take a single picture.</p>
<p>But then... I had a minor epiphany.</p>
<p>With the Harbor Freight Crimper, dies are not properly ground for wire sizes. But. But.</p>
<p>Just like with hammering, we can crimp progressively until we &quot;flow&quot; all the strands and the barrel
into one solid piece!</p>
<p>Here's the approach (okay, this is the <em>final</em> procedure, first try did not include turning - but I
did it (admittedly, accidentally), and liked the results a lot).</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Given wire gauge of, say, 6</li>
<li>Use die 2 sizes up - so, die marked for #2 wire</li>
<li>Put the wire in the terminal. Start by squeezing the terminal turned 90 degrees (so &quot;side to side&quot; rather then &quot;top to bottom&quot;). Just give it a gentle oval shape</li>
<li>Now, turn it 90 degrees and squeeze until the jaws close</li>
<li>At this point, you will have a somewhat <em>undercrimped</em> joint, as I described in my notes on the crimper; but it's shape will be a perfect hex.</li>
<li>Now, go 1 size &quot;down&quot; (so, dies marked for #4 wire). Squeeze.</li>
<li>Stop when you feel it's done shrinking.</li>
</ul>
<p>Results?</p>

one on the picture. And I can't rip it off! I can't remove the conduit to immerse it into whatever solvent will cut the glue
without some major surgery, so I guess the new fuse block will go on top of it.</p>

<h2>Switch Anti-Rotation Holes</h2>
<p>You have probably figured by now that I have a taste for misery, and for ranting about how miserable that or this was :). If
you read a <em>few</em> notes in this Dear Diary, you will notice a trend - that I tend to come up with ways  of making myself
aggravated, very consistently and reliably.</p>
<p>Well, this time it was the &quot;anti-rotation&quot; holes for switches in the panel; and the plan was to drill them from
the <em>back side</em> of the panel <em>not quite all the way thru</em> (yay, no access and contortionism again!)</p>
<p>Every switch, circuit breaker, and certainly, a dimmer, comes with a &quot;keyed&quot; washer to prevent it's rotation. That means
you're drilling two holes - one for the appliance (switch, or whatever), and the other for the little tab that's on the
washer.</p>
<p>Picture explains this better. Here is a little hole template I quickly drew in Solidworks, properly dimensioned,
with washers from (left to right) the circuit breaker, switch, and the dimmer.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-09-10-panel-holes-compass/p-2.jpg" title="Holes template" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-09-10-panel-holes-compass/p-2-thumb.jpg" title="Holes template" alt="Holes template" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Holes template</p><p>See, Remo didn't have those &quot;secondary&quot; holes on the panel - so I had to drill them (especially for the dimmer).</p>
<p>But wait, you ask. If you drill holes, that will be ugly - a hole next to every switch?</p>
<p>Yup. Aha. Agreed! Though the nuts are supposed to cover them, they, I'm pretty sure, from my testing at least, wouldn't
have...</p>
<p>No problem! Remo made the panel from 1/8&quot; thick aluminum, and I needed maybe <em>half</em> that much for the tabs to go in. So
the plan was to very carefully drill them just deep enough to house the tabs.</p>
<p>Made me a nice little set of templates...</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-09-10-panel-holes-compass/p-3.jpg" title="Templates in the making" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-09-10-panel-holes-compass/p-3-thumb.jpg" title="Templates in the making" alt="Templates in the making" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Templates in the making</p><p>...out of a small piece of aluminum, drilled holes using my paper template, and cut them up...</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-09-10-panel-holes-compass/p-4.jpg" title="Templates, cut up" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-09-10-panel-holes-compass/p-4-thumb.jpg" title="Templates, cut up" alt="Templates, cut up" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Templates, cut up</p><p>...and cleaned up the holes and edges.</p>
<p>The plan was, to put a template like a &quot;washer&quot; around a switch/CB/..., and center punch the secondary, small, hole, thru it.
Then, I'll have punch marks to drill, and will have to either get to them from the side of the plane, or, more likely, from the <em>back</em> of
the panel while sitting in the seat and <em>not seeing where they are while drilling</em>, using a mirror to position the drill
first.</p>
<p>Like I said, I have a taste for misery.</p>
<p>So there we went, punching the back side.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Center-punching on the back side of the panel</p><p>Click-clickity-clack.</p>
<p>Cling! Ding! Ding dang dong.. it sounded like a chunk of metal just fell off the plane and dropped on the cockpit floor.</p>
<p>!??!?&#64;??!??! <em>What the h... did I break?!</em></p>
<p>I crawled out from behind the panel and looked into the cockpit.</p>
<p>On the floor, looking at me, and almost smiling, was...</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Placard!</p><p>...this. Remo's placard that went around the switches. Like so:</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-09-10-panel-holes-compass/p-2-3.jpg" title="Placards - in place" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-09-10-panel-holes-compass/p-2-3-thumb.jpg" title="Placards - in place" alt="Placards - in place" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Placards - in place</p><p>Wait, wait wait wait. It came <em>off</em>. But it will be held back by the switches' nuts when the switches are in. And.. cover
the holes! That means, I don't need to drill the holes from the back side and worry about punching thru (or not going deep enough) - I can comfortably sit in the cockpit and
drill them from the front! All the way thru! The placard will cover them! In my search for misery, did I luck out?! :)</p>
<p>In retrospect, this (and the opposite side's) placard were probably not glued. No need - switches' nuts hold them just fine.</p>
<p>They were stuck because Remo probably installed them on top of the paint that didn't fully cure - and it just stuck to the backside
of placards over the years, under the pressure from switches' nuts.</p>
<p>I stuck my nail under the opposite side placard, and it came off with a little force.</p>
<p>Ha!</p>
<p>Well, it was smooth sailing from there...</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Marking from the front</p><p>... relatively speaking, of course. I still had to hold up the vacuum with my knee, and maneuver the sharp drill,
making sure to be extra careful not to poke it into anything important (like, fabric on the sides).</p>

<h2>Dimmer Pot</h2>
<p>That sucker has 1/4&quot; diameter threads; and all the holes I have in the panel are 1/2... Without some serious bushings, or
other mods, or a new hole.. ugh.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Possible pot locations</p><p>I was hoping to stick it into the old &quot;Master Circuit Breaker&quot; hole (marked (2) above), but it was waaaay too big.</p>
<p>Looking around, looking around.... aha! Here's a number 8 or 10 screw plugging a hole! I can enlarge it and we'll be
in business! (marked (1)).</p>
<p>Yep. Good luck, buddy. That was an even <em>bigger</em> hole that was plugged with a #8 screw in a countersunk finishing
washer... hmmm... maybe that will work out for the pot too?</p>
<p>You know, drilling a #10 countersunk washer to have a 1/4&quot; hole in it is... hard? Annoying? You can't really grip
it in any manner without damaging it, you can't hold it in your fingers... I think I lucked out on my third try, with combination
of a Unibit and light clamping of that washer in a vice.</p>
<p>With that re-drilled countersunk washer, the pot mounts just fine in hole #2. And #1 got plugged back :).</p>

<h2>Compass Mount</h2>
<p>Well, after all that excitement compass mount was almost anti climactic. I toyed with the idea of putting it into the panel
(and relocating G-meter into a new hole I'd cut around where the ignition switch was - see, after
<a class="reference external" href="http://79ft.net/entries/2019-09-08-fwf-side-channel-panel-layouts/">having failed relocating Hobbs there</a>, the idea of still
making a bigger hole in the panel keeps nagging me :).</p>
<p>No good. When that much down, too much steel around it confuses the compass to the tune of about 30 degrees... No need to
add extra problems in already a magnetically problematic plane.</p>
<p>So, top it was to be. The windshield will get in the way, but I really, really didn't want to take it off (~20 #6
screws and nuts in a tight spot is no fun).</p>
<p>Eyeballed the bracket alignment with the fuselage centerline and put it in the right spot...</p>
<p>Damn! Sharpie's too tall to get in there to mark the holes <em>vertically</em>. &quot;Angle Sharpie Adapter&quot;... hmm..</p>

quite a few, mostly unrelated, things that I did in the last few days, and it would've made sense to keep
them separate.</p>
<p>However; finally decided to make just one big article with all of them. None of them are finished; but somewhat a decent
chunk of work is - I think I have <em>mostly</em> figured out where everything will go and how it will all come together.</p>
<p>I guess, what I'm trying to say is, if you clicked on the &quot;Panel Layout&quot; entry in the Log, and are trying to figure out why

<li>Main Connector is gone. I was convinced that reliability concerns outweigh the benefits of having it. Plus, I have very
little precious room to work with.</li>
<li>Physically, it's easier to hook up the LR3C Sense wire to a different spot - on the Shunt stud rather than to the
Master Contactor/Starter Contactor jumper directly. It makes no difference, it's the same circuit - just a different hookup spot to it.</li>

<h2>Firewall Forward</h2>
<p>I started trying things around firewall forward while
<a class="reference external" href="http://79ft.net/entries/2019-09-01-carb-cables/">figuring out routing and lengths for carb control cables</a>, and continued
afterwards.</p>

<div class="section" id="contactors">
<h4>Contactors</h4>
<p>It became obvious fairly quickly that I won't be able to use the nice B&amp;C Starter Contactor because of it's mounting
holes not being the same as a very common SS581 Starter Solenoid that was set up by Remo. Also, the way terminals
were set up on the B&amp;C Starter Contactor would have made them closer to the carb control cables. And, I didn't want to drill more
holes in the firewall.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">SS581 Contactor</p><p>So I decided to go with SS581-style and ordered one from Vans. While waiting for it, I used the old one just to mock
things up.</p>
<p>And because it doesn't have the spike catcher diode, I had to get me a couple IN5400s, and soldered an extension lead to one
of them.</p>

<div class="section" id="battery-and-starter-wires">
<h4>Battery and Starter Wires</h4>
<p>Those are the thickest wires, and routing them is more complicated than the other ones. In addition, the
battery + -&gt; master contactor wire is the only wire that can't be turned off, and therefore needs to be very well
thought out and as short as possible.</p>
<p>Here's something else, too. The Charger was set up to ground the battery to the motor. So far, so good - starter is by far
the largest consumer in the electrical system. However, nothing was done to ground the motor to the rest of the airplane!</p>
<p>So the rest of the system was probably grounded via whatever metal to metal connections there were on the motor.
Control cables and braided fuel and oil hoses? ;) Airbox bowden &quot;carb heat&quot; cable... I can't think of much more else.</p>
<p>Initially, I was planning to run a ground strap braid from the battery negative to one of the bolts holding the battery
box to the firewall, but with fuel system components and control cables around, just couldn't figure out a good way to run
it and support it. I had to end up settling for running it to the engine mount instead.</p>
<p>So the bottom line is, the negative 4GA cable is gonna go to the motor, and parallel to it a braid will go to the motor mount.
I also figured out a clamp arrangement with some standoffs that will keep the wires neat and organized.</p>

would look with the wire jumpers</p>

<div class="section" id="side-conduit">
<h2>Side Conduit</h2>
<p>The Voltage Regulator and the Main Terminal/Fuse Block were to go to the Side Conduit running alongside the fuselage.</p>

   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-09-08-fwf-side-channel-panel-layouts/cond-1-thumb.jpg" title="Rough component locations" alt="Rough component locations" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Rough component locations</p><p>I had to relocate the bowdens lower to free up some space.  The Oil Cooler box on this plane is all sorts of weird, including a flapper valve controlled by one of those bowdens that closes up the airflow to it (which is not enough to begin with; being a 1.5&quot; SCAT takeoff off of back baffle.. but don't get me started on that). That cable turned out to be too short when
relocated - but I lucked out - Glenn had a bowden going to the Rotec TBI that I removed for &quot;prime&quot; function, and that bowden was plenty
long. I'll trim it to final length when I'm done in that side conduit.</p>
<p>The brake tube was running inside the conduit, and I will have to relocate it to run below the conduit and be supported
by adel clamps. For now, I unhooked it and used it to somewhat mock up the new run. Tube and fittings ordered,
and tubing bender already here!</p>
<div class="section" id="fuse-block">
<h3>Fuse Block</h3>
<p>I was gonna use a 20-position fuse block from B&amp;C. Well, <em>that</em> didn't go too well.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Fuse block</p><p>Tight! I basically lose the whole top row of fuses with it. Not enough room....</p>
<p>After poking around the Internets for a bit, came to these nice fuse blocks made by Blue Sea Systems. Longest ones they
have are 8 fuses, so I will need two (if I recall correctly, I have 13 fuses in the diagram currently, and I want some spare
positions for later if I need them).</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Blue Sea Systems fuse block</p><p>Much better! Plus, they use ring terminals rather than tabs - and while tabs are light and simple, I don't like them.
Removing them is hard, and, when removed, the terminal loses a lot of it's grip. It's almost like an &quot;assemble once&quot; type
deal.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="voltage-regulator">
<h3>Voltage Regulator</h3>
<p>With how the wire harness is gonna go in that conduit, and with bowdens being where they are, the best orientation for the
Voltage Regulator would've been &quot;upside down&quot;, with terminal strip up.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-09-08-fwf-side-channel-panel-layouts/cond-7.jpg" title="Upside Down orientation" >

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Upside Down orientation</p><p>Damn you, the yellow sticker on the regulator! DAMN you! (hint: read it :) ).</p>
<p>Mounting it sideways, I'd have a line of rivet heads under it - which I didn't want to deal with.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Sideways orientation</p><p>And mounting it down... Down was annoying because of the clamp for bowdens and bowdens close there. That would also
complicate wiring.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Down orientation</p><p>Upside down would've been perfect... except for that yellow sticker :). So, I decided to Hail Mary and asked nice folks at
B&amp;C about what they thought.</p>
<p>See, the problem is I know why they wanted the terminal strip to be pointed down. It's so that water won't get into the
box in case of condensation accumulating on it. But I thought, maybe I can seal it somehow?</p>
<p>The answer from TJ at B&amp;C was a resounding no. Right side up, sideways - but not upside down.</p>
<p>So I mocked up the right side up mounting...</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-09-08-fwf-side-channel-panel-layouts/cond-12.jpg" title="Right side up mockup" >

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Right side up mockup</p><p>Yuck. Yeah; it'd work; but it's ugly as hell.</p>
<p>The only other option would be sideways, but on &quot;standoffs&quot; of sorts to clear the rivet heads. I mentioned that to TJ, and he
said that that could work, but I should check if I can access the voltage adjustment screw on the top of the box.</p>
<p>Damn it! I forgot about it. On the top of the box there's a plug over a hole that opens up access to a tiny screw to adjust
buss voltage - basically, to fine tune how much volts the battery sees. Not something you do often, but you want to be able
to do it.</p>
<p>But then, TJ mentioned that he saw the holes in the firewall and that might be the saving grace.</p>
<p>Bingo!</p>
<p>I tried it out again in vertical, now with mocked up standoffs</p>

in the firewall (this hole was left over from the brake line relocation), pop the plug on the voltage regulator, and
just have enough access to the adjustment screw.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Unsightly hole</p><p>... and I thought, maybe I could put the Hobbs back there?</p>
<p>My initial tests with one of the  2 1/4 gauges I have removed seemed to have been okay: there was <em>just enough</em> room
in there to get another 2 1/4 gauge in.</p>
<p>So, I got me a very nice panel punch that could make a nice, round, clean hole in place.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-09-08-fwf-side-channel-panel-layouts/punch.jpg" title="Instrument Hole Punch" >

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Instrument Hole Punch</p><p>Well, next was to remove the Hobbs from the front panel. <em>That</em> was an hour of contortionism. The Hobbs is
held by an aluminum backplate and
four nylock nuts, so I <em>had</em> to have a wrench over them the <em>whole</em> time. Oh, the screws are way too long BTW, so taking all
them out took about five times more turns than it should've, while I was wondering if my wrists will take this much
flexing, twisting, and bending any longer.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Mounting ring</p><p>This is a pic from the fuel quantity gauge held in the same manner, but here he's using brass flat type nuts that you can
hold with your fingers. On the Hobbs, it was nylocks.</p>
<p>Anyway, I got it out.  And then, started setting up for punching that hole.
Removed VSI to give me a bit more room to work with.</p>
<p>I tried to reconstruct exactly what happened next in my memory to write it down here, and could not.
I was basically fiddling, checking clearances, making sure I'll be able to hook up the punch and center the hole, have
enough room for the mounting ring in the back and clear everything I had to clear, when I discovered that...</p>
<p>The Hobbs was <em>not</em> a standard 2 1/4 inch gauge - it was a touch <em>bigger</em>. So the hole that I would've made would've been
too small for it. And that if I punched the hole, I would've been just left with a bigger hole and nothing to
put in there.</p>
<p>Damn, damn, damn! Damn you, assumptions that every &quot;small&quot; gauge on an airplane is 2 1/4!</p>
<p>And I had the expensive punch that I had no use for :(.</p>
<p>Oh well. Thanks God I actually did <em>not</em> do it - only to have a <em>larger</em> hole to plug up. I guess, that Hobbs is (thru
more contortionism) going back to the front panel.</p>
<p>As they say, Le Sigh.</p>

left over placards from fuses that were there in the old electrical system). The little brass knob on the right is gonna
be panel lighting control pot.</p>

<p>It's a bit taller than the whiskey compass, so I'm playing with different mount locations. I think this is what it will be;
with shock isolating rubber pad under the mount where the gap is at the moment.</p>

<hr class="dashed"/><p>Doing the <a class="reference external" href="/category/chickenhouse-chargerelectrical-rebuild.html">electrical rebuild on the Charger</a>, I needed
to terminate quite a few of heavy wires with large lug type Amp terminal rings.</p>
<p>I had a Harbor Freight hydraulic crimper lying around that I got to crimp a couple wires when I was
<a class="reference external" href="http://79ft.net/entries/cgr-30/">installing CRG-30P on the Cheetah</a>, and was planning on using it; though the type of crimps produced by it kinda bugged me.</p>
<p>After doing a few crimps, I decided to burn a few terminals and do a proper test.</p>
<div class="section" id="the-crimper">
<h2>The Crimper</h2>
<p>Normally, crimpers for large size terminals are super expensive; but Harbor Freight, as usual, sells
a hydraulic crimper with large dies for just about fifty bucks.</p>
<p>Here it is, in it's full glory.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Dies</p><p>Technically, the way it's designed is it's supposed to produce these nice hexagonal crimps. Or at least, I think that's
what they were trying to do.</p>
<p>But those familiar with crimpers know that the key is in good dies; and that's were most of the money is. Damn, &quot;regular&quot;
stripping dies for StripMaster are what, $10; while milspec dies are what, $150? Now; of course there's diminishing
returns there - in the case of StripMaster, regular dies work just fine for most applications.</p>
<p>Here's the problem with HF Crimper dies. The holes in them are severely <strong>undersized</strong>, which makes them produce &quot;flat&quot;,
rather than hexagonal crimps. We can't know if this is by design. What I tried to do is to research what others are doing,
and to run a few &quot;is this a good crimp&quot; tests.</p>

<p>I went next size up, to dies marked for 6 AWG. That produced the same crimp as for 8 AWG, but with &quot;wings&quot; being thinner -
almost paper-thin. I also didn't like how it mangled the terminal even more.</p>
<p>Somebody online mentioned that they rotated the crimp 90 degrees and did it again to &quot;push the wings in&quot; and I tried that.</p>

<h2>Using 4 AWG Dies</h2>
<p>Finally, I tried 4 AWG dies.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">4 AWG die / crimp</p><p>This crimp almost looks good. The jog is almost not there, and it has nice hexagonal shape. &quot;Wings&quot; are almost not present.</p>
<p>However, the dies closed fully and it felt to me that the metal was not compressed enough (I recall the resistance I felt
in the crimper doing the previous two tests, and the resistance I felt on this one was much less).</p>
<p>The cutaway confirmed that.</p>

<div class="section" id="conclusion">
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Well, it's a sad one really. If you want to use the HF tool, then you probably should use dies that make those &quot;winged&quot;
style crimps (like the one produced in my first test), and suck up the jog and other imperfections.</p>
<p>I have posted my findings on AeroElectric list, and the conclusions seems to be supported - the dies are horrible, and to
make them real good one would need to rework them significantly.</p>

<p>Or, alternatively, just solder them (<a class="reference external" href="/files/aeroelectric/big_term.pdf">here's a nice howto by Mr. Nuckolls</a>) ,
which is what I am seriously considering.</p>

<h2>Update - October 2019</h2>
<p>After <a class="reference external" href="http://79ft.net/entries/2019-10-08-good-crimps/">trying and failing the soldering approach</a>, I have devised a technique of using this crimper to achieve
good results. Musings linked in the previous sentence, and here's the jist:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Given wire gauge of, say, 6</li>
<li>Use die 2 sizes up - so, die marked for #2 wire</li>
<li>Put the wire in the terminal. Start by squeezing the terminal turned 90 degrees (so &quot;side to side&quot; rather then &quot;top to bottom&quot;). Just give it a gentle oval shape</li>
<li>Now, turn it 90 degrees and squeeze until the jaws close</li>
<li>At this point, you will have a somewhat <em>undercrimped</em> joint, as I described in my notes on the crimper; but it's shape will be a perfect hex.</li>
<li>Now, go 1 size &quot;down&quot; (so, dies marked for #4 wire). Squeeze.</li>
<li>Stop when you feel it's done shrinking.</li>
</ul>

<hr class="dashed"/><p>So most orders have been placed, and a lot of them have arrived already. (Note to self: need to take pictures of all the stuff).</p>
<p>The first thing to be worked on is the heart - the alternator.</p>
<p>Look at this little beauty!</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">B&C L-40</p><p>Tiny, light as a feather, and cute as a button! No, sir, this thing has to get attached to the nose!</p>
<p>The old one needs to come off. Pivot arm bolt undone. Pivot bold undone.</p>
<p>Wait. The pivot bolt can't get out, because the flywheel gets in the way...</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Pivot bolt and interference</p><p>Hmm.. No, I can't believe Remo pulled the flywheel off of crank just to install the alternator. There must be a better
way.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">The better way - bracket attach bolts!</p><p>Aha! This is case mount, and the bracket is attached to the motor case. Let's see... Yep! It came off.</p>
<p>Now, the new bracket... centers nicely!</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-08-16-alternator-fitting/a-8.jpg" title="New bracket" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-08-16-alternator-fitting/a-8-thumb.jpg" title="New bracket" alt="New bracket" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">New bracket</p><p>See that ear on the right, that touches the starter boss? That one needs to attach to the starter, to prevent
the bracket flexing left and right. It lines up great, but, problem number one (but I knew this one), the old
alternator bracket didn't have that. Remo used that hole on the starter boss to hook up the front of the nose &quot;ramp&quot; part of
the baffle:</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-08-16-alternator-fitting/a-2.jpg" title="Baffle attach bracket" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-08-16-alternator-fitting/a-2-thumb.jpg" title="Baffle attach bracket" alt="Baffle attach bracket" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Baffle attach bracket</p><p>No matter. I will just bend up a new one, to account for the thickness of the new bracket's &quot;ear&quot; that will get sandwiched
between this baffle attach bracket, and the starter boss. Material already ordered!</p>
<p>Now, let's test fit the belt, and the new pivot arm. The belt, the belt.. oh wait. Yep. The prop needs to come off - but this
is a non-event now (and I am not leaving the prop off again -
<a class="reference external" href="http://79ft.net/entries/2019-05-17-race-for-the-engine/">learned that one already</a>). I'm becoming quite good at
this prop pulling business....</p>
<p>Belt on and prop back on, test-fitting the pivot arm... CRUD!</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-08-16-alternator-fitting/a-10.jpg" title="Pivot arm" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-08-16-alternator-fitting/a-10-thumb.jpg" title="Pivot arm" alt="Pivot arm" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Pivot arm</p><p>That black bracket to the left of it holds the hose &quot;ramp&quot; portion of the baffle..... and, it won't let the damn pivot
arm go in! No way. And no easy modification here - it's interfering, seriously...</p>
<p>Frankly, at that point I went home (this whole note covers quite a few days of work), with thoughts of remaking the
front baffle; and spent the evening researching how baffles are done on planes with similar nosebowl... Frankly,
I don't like how this front baffle is done on this plane (see
<a class="reference external" href="http://79ft.net/entries/2019-05-17-cowling-conundrum/">Cowling Conundrum</a>), and thought of this as being a good
chance to fix it. I moaned about this to my buddy and colleague Dima D (who's helping me here quite a lot with notes
and advice)...</p>
<p>But next nite, I thought that maybe I can get away with remaking just the arm... I am absolutely not set up to do complicated
sheet metal work at the moment...</p>
<p>The old alternator had this weird pivot arm that now made way more sense. It &quot;doglegged&quot; around the bracket with which
the standard pivot arm interfered:</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-08-16-alternator-fitting/a-11.jpg" title="The old pivot arm" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-08-16-alternator-fitting/a-11-thumb.jpg" title="The old pivot arm" alt="The old pivot arm" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">The old pivot arm</p><p>Notice how it has this portion that goes down, and then the pivot arm &quot;turns&quot; left to go under the nose baffle ramp attach
bracket?</p>
<p>That corner is definitely a large stress riser... but this arm held a much heavier Delco-Remy alternator for almost 40 years...
Granted, it's made out of 0.190 steel as opposed to 0.125 steel used in B&amp;C bracket... but I can make a similar one for
the new alternator...</p>
<p>We'll see if we can smooth out that corner so that it's arcing better, reducing stress. If I can, I will use 0.125 steel.
If I can't, I'll settle with 0.190 - just like the old one. We know this works.</p>
<p>Thanks Dima! You were right. For now. I will redo this nose ramp when I'm redoing the motor, later :).</p>
<p>... and now, to the belt. Let's get this nose ramp back on. It has an opening for the belt to pass thru, and a fairing
for the alternator pulley....</p>
<p>Damn. Yep. That one doesn't fit right, either.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-08-16-alternator-fitting/a-13.jpg" title="Nose ramp back on" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-08-16-alternator-fitting/a-13-thumb.jpg" title="Nose ramp back on" alt="Nose ramp back on" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Nose ramp back on</p><p>If you look real careful inside the red circle, you can just see the belt there. It will rub on the left edge of that hole.
It has to go right, which means the alternator has to go down, which means longer belt.</p>
<p>I used a piece of wire to mock this up. Here are a couple of pictures from the back side.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Wire mocking up a longer belt - so that it's centered in the hole</p><p>I ordered a couple of longer belts from the same series, to try them out and see how they will work in the end...</p>
<p>So, where are we at?</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>I will need a new, smaller, bracket for the front support of that nose baffle ramp (the bracket will attach to the starter, same place as before)</li>
<li>I will need to design and make a new pivot arm - and to learn how to make nice slots with hand tools</li>
<li>A different belt</li>
</ul>
<p>Meanwhile, folks at B&amp;C were extremely helpful and generous with their time, reading my long, ranty, emails, and responding
to me with their thoughts. I really appreciated that!</p>
