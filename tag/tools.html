<hr class="dashed"/><p>Well, since it seems now that my Hangar will become my shop for a while with me doing the
<a class="reference external" href="http://79ft.net/entries/2019-05-16-fire-hazard/">electrical rebuild</a> on the Charger,
I decided to set myself up in it. I am still rebuilding the main shop at the house (reminder: need to write up a couple notes on that),
so the only place I have to work on the plane is in the hangar - and frankly, I probably wouldn't have dragged the whole thing over
to the house anyway just for an electrical rebuild... though it is getting hot, and being in a tin can of a hangar when it's 100 degrees outside
is not.. pleasant, shall we say.</p>
<p>At any rate, the Hangar is now to be officially known as The Dream Shop, Georgetown Annex!</p>
<p>Not much to tell - but much to show here.</p>
<div class="section" id="easy-route">
<h2>Easy Route</h2>
<p>I didn't have anything in the hangar besides a couple of old bookshelves, a couple of small tables, a few filing cabinets I have inherited from my
good friend Pete, and a cart. Not very nicely set up for working on airplanes, and everything was overflowing with parts, tools,
and hardware even after just a bit of disassembly I have done for the annual.</p>
<p>I needed a lot of shelf space, and a lot of bench space.</p>
<p>I decided to take an easy route this time, and instead of building everything, just bought a bunch of shelves at Costco, and benches
and a tool cart at ... Harbor Freight. Yep, I know. Throw a rotten egg in my face next time you see me.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">The First Shelf</p></div>
<div class="section" id="the-light">
<h2>The Light</h2>
<p>I work evenings a lot, and the only light source there was there was a four T8 tube fixture in the back of the hangar.
But the most interesting stuff is on the front of it (engine, yep :) ). So I added some lights around the front.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-06-17-hangar-redo/hr-2.jpg" title="Lights" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-06-17-hangar-redo/hr-2-thumb.jpg" title="Lights" alt="Lights" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Lights</p></div>
<div class="section" id="the-benches">
<h2>The Benches</h2>
<p>Next, came the benches from Harbor Freight. Don't buy them. They're built like crap, and, frankly, I think I could've built better ones out of
2x4s in about the same amount of time it took me to put these together... But hey, I already bought them, and disassembling the first one
(I got three total) rather than putting the other two together... I didn't want to...</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-06-17-hangar-redo/hr-3.jpg" title="Benches" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-06-17-hangar-redo/hr-3-thumb.jpg" title="Benches" alt="Benches" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Benches</p><p>You might notice the pegboard at the back &quot;wall&quot; of those benches. Well, they attach it every about 12 inches around the perimeter with machine
screws and nuts. Guess what happened to the first pegboard after a humidity cycled high, and then low? Yep; it all warped!</p>
<p>Ended up resorting to straightening it out with shelves that acted as &quot;stiffeners&quot;,  and putting the warped pegboard bench as far
away from the &quot;main&quot; bench as possible).</p>
<p>On the other two I actually made the pegboard &quot;floating&quot; - re-drilled the mounting holes to be large, and used large washers and just enough
small washers underneath to MacGyver me a &quot;bushing&quot;. That worked, and the other two benches' pegboard is straight after quite a few large
humidity changes now.</p>
<p>And then, the sink.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-sink">
<h2>The Sink</h2>
<p>I long had a large 7 gallon jug with a tap. When I was doing a lot of work, I'd drag it out of the hangar, put it on a small folding table, and
use it to wash my hands. Very nice to be able to do that when your hands are covered in oil and crud, and you need to climb into the airplane
or grab something generally clean. I also like clean hands when doing detail work like soldering, painting, etc.</p>

   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-06-17-hangar-redo/hr-4-thumb.jpg" title="The Jug" alt="The Jug" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">The Jug</p><p>But dragging out a 7 gallon jug every time I got into the hangar got very old very fast, and I ended up typically resorting to rags and not
so clean hands, or &quot;washing&quot; them with mineral spirits... ugh.</p>
<p>But hey, we're cleaning up! So I decided to put in...</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-06-17-hangar-redo/hr-5.jpg" title="The Sink!" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-06-17-hangar-redo/hr-5-thumb.jpg" title="The Sink!" alt="The Sink!" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">The Sink!</p><p>But a sink needs a drain!</p>
<p>No problem.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-06-17-hangar-redo/hr-6.jpg" title="The Drain." >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-06-17-hangar-redo/hr-6-thumb.jpg" title="The Drain." alt="The Drain." >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">The Drain.</p><p>This came out very nice, and I love that I can now just wash my hands whenever, no jug dragging required.</p>
<p>The best part? The hangar door slides, so I can have it <em>closed</em> and then slide it a bit past it's &quot;closed&quot; position, so that there's a gap
between the hangar divider wall and the outside for the drain to be put out.</p>
<p>But how do I close the door?</p>

</div>
<div class="section" id="the-wiring">
<h2>The Wiring</h2>
<p><em>Before you wire your plane, wire your hangar</em>, says a proverb. Or something like that.</p>
<p>Well, my hangar floods. And it's not <em>my</em> hangar, so I can't quite make holes in the walls and run wiring and conduit. And I only have one outlet.
Yep.</p>
<p>So it was all to be a bunch of extension cords, making sure that all connections are suspended a few inches above the floor, hooked to
something (previous tenant of my hangar had some holes in the walls drilled, so I reused his, or hooked them up to legs of whatever was there, etc).</p>
<p>I ended up making a bunch of splices on extension cords. Hey, I love soldering!</p>

<div class="section" id="air-and-shelves">
<h2>Air and Shelves</h2>
<p>I had a compressor. I moved it to the back corner of the hanger, and hooked up a reel in the front, so that I can have my hoses neat...
Not much more.</p>
<p>The back wall of the hangar got lined with the big shelves, too... Mostly, to stack the parts I take off the plane and need to keep off.</p>
<p>The first one up is there on the right, near the yellow barrel.</p>

<h2>The Shrine</h2>
<p>... and since the Charger is a Grand Champion, I needed a shrine in the &quot;mancave corner&quot; of the hangar. Every hangar must have a
corner with a couch, a fridge and what-not, to relax and ponder and procrastinate. And that's where all the artifacts need to go.</p>

</div>
<div class="section" id="the-bench">
<h2>The Bench</h2>
<p>I needed at least one good bench for grinders, bandsaw, and aluminum work; and there was a perfect spot for it. Didn't have my wood tools
though, so had to use 2x4s straight out of the store... Normally, I mill them down :).</p>

<hr class="dashed"/><p><a class="reference external" href="http://79ft.net/entries/pickles/">As we have established before</a>, Fall for Russians is all about pickling things.</p>
<p>Last time it was an O-360. This time, it's tools for the new shop.</p>
<p>My current shop is all packed up and in storage, waiting for the actual
shop to be built. Well, actually for the building to be gutted.</p>
<p>When I have built the new house, I have kept the old house. That's what's
about to become my Dream Shop. Meanwhile, all my tools are nicely set up
in my storage shed, waiting for their time.</p>
<p>I have sold most of my Chinese Grizzly crap I bought before knowing
any better, and was hunting good, old, American-made machines for a while.</p>
<p>Okay, I settled for a Chinese-made Powermatic drill press, arguing with
myself that it was in mint shape, dialed in with no obvious runout / shake,
and would be my wood-only press anyway.</p>
<p>But two most important things wood-wise I still didn't have: a jointer and a
table saw. Few had come up on Craigslist, and I would go over to check them out
with all my dial gauges and a U-Haul trailer in tow.</p>
<p>I would spend close to an hour with each one of them, measuring all sorts of
convoluted alignments and run-outs, only to find something very <em>basic</em> wrong
with them.</p>
<p>One of these was a newer (mustard, but still American-made) PM60 jointer. It
checked out reasonably well; until I asked the guy if I could adjust his fence
square (I wanted to check it's warp by measuring squareness to tables along
it's length).</p>
<p>&quot;Sure Thing!&quot; - he said, walked to a corner of his shop, picked up a hammer,
and ... WHACK! - ... ... yeah. Call me a WHACK-o, but that is <em>not</em> how you
adjust squareness...  Not in my book. I felt for the poor machine.</p>
<p>I left, of course.</p>
<p>Another time I spent just south of 40 minutes with a PM66 table saw, only to check
it's flatness dead last. Of course, it was so horribly bowed out of shape,
I had to leave. And <em>that</em> was a 3 hour drive. Each way, mind you!</p>
<p>At any rate, yet another PM60 jointer popped up on Craigslist, and I grabbed
a trailer in preparation of going to San Antonio the next day. That's where
the jointer was.</p>
<p>Now, there was a rolling joke with one of the guys from the office - that he
absolutely HAS to convince yet another guy from our office, his buddy, to
sell me his PM66 saw - or, Russian Mafia will get him! Them both, in fact!</p>
<p>I kept it up for over a year; and I am not sure if that joke had made any
contribution to this... but, he called me and said, &quot;Roger is selling his
Powermatic! Grab it, QUICK!&quot;. Same day as the jointer popped up.</p>
<p>Hah. So tomorrow I am about to go possibly pick up a jointer.
Did I just land me a saw too?</p>
<p>I went to Roger's to dial the saw.</p>
<p>Arbor was shot, but trunnions were in great shape, and arbor for PM-66 is not
a problem (someone still literally makes them and sells them on EBay). The
tables were flat aside from a very tiny dip, a bit dirty at that, but alright.</p>
<p>I decided to pick it up.</p>
<p>So I did land me a saw and a possible jointer!!!</p>
<p>Next day (Friday), I rush to San Antonio to look at the jointer.</p>
<p>It was a green, older one, and it checked out good, except one minor
mis-alignment of infeed and outfeed tables. I was trying to tighten them up
a touch with gib set screws, and... I broke one of them.</p>
<p>The tables were flat, the motor was good, and the price was reasonable though,
so I decided to buy it from the guy - especially after I broke it :).</p>
<p>Didn't take any pictures of jointer in transit... damn.</p>
<p>So, Friday night Im back, barely manage to roll the jointer off the trailer and into the garage, and Saturday I pack my wrenches and such to go break down the saw at Roger's.</p>
<p>See, it was set up with a large side table, router plate insert, and outfeeds
- no way I would've been able to load all that; and besides,  I don't need
any of that aside from core saw. I already have all my router stuff from
my previous shop (<a class="reference external" href="http://www.incrementaltools.com/">Incra</a> no less).</p>
<p>It's raining. Damn.</p>
<p>I get to his place - he's gone for the weekend, his wife lets me in and leaves
me alone with the saw and my tools.</p>

<hr class="dashed"/><p>After using <a class="reference external" href="http://79ft.net/entries/2014-05-20-b-log/">the setup I did for myself in 2014</a> for a while,  I decided it was time to change things around a bit.</p>
<div class="section" id="segway">
<h2>Segway</h2>
<p><em>... so yeah. I needed to add a static page, and I had a bunch of ideas about
extra stuff I wanted to do for a while. But mostly, I just needed to add a
damn static page, and thinking about coercing the existing setup into
doing that with all the pictures I needed there was not making me happy...</em></p>
<p><em>... it was also about time I set this thing up so that I could actually
log more projects than just a single airplane. Hey, I bet we all
know - websites of this kind are mostly created to be later enjoyed by their
authors in periods of 'I ain't got nothing better to do than review
my old notes' mood ...</em></p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="multiple-projects">
<h2>Multiple Projects</h2>
<p>First of all, I wanted to be able to log multiple projects. The way the old
setup was done was it had basically one project, under the section
called &quot;Build&quot;, and then this dangling catch-all &quot;blog&quot; thing for everything
else.</p>
<p>But as you can see, most of articles here actually are NOT about the airplane
I was working on at the time - the Skybolt - but rather, other little things
here and there.</p>
<p>First thing I did, is I changed the way the files are laid out, and added
semantics converting source content's directory structure to
&quot;Project / Section&quot; semantics.</p>
<p>Each project now has it's own &quot;sub-log&quot; (that's what time logged is tracked
based on). There is still a catch-all &quot;blog&quot; section, and a &quot;default&quot;
project that can be configured if one so desires.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="logging">
<h2>Logging</h2>
<p>One more thing I realised is that the original version would only allow to log
time if it was associated with an article-type entry... Flooding the Internet
with tens of pages of &quot;built three more ribs tonight&quot; type stuff <em>just to log
time</em> seemed kinda silly, so I added support for plain text log entries.</p>
<p>Articles still can track time; but you can also now have a separate text
file with just &quot;Date&quot;, &quot;Summary&quot;, and &quot;Time Logged&quot; entries - one per line.</p>
<p>When creating the &quot;log&quot; page for a project, entries, being both
from articles and from logfiles, are sorted by date,
and then ones with articles associated with them will pick their summaries up
from articles. Entries coming from text files will be displayed with summaries
from log files.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="major-code-cleanup">
<h2>Major Code Cleanup</h2>
<p>All this time tracking functionality, structuring articles into projects, and
such, were becoming  an entity of its own large enough for me to justify
clumping it all into a single Pelican's plugin, now called &quot;b_log&quot;. I also
added a bunch of config options to set up it's behavior.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="no-google-analytics">
<h2>No Google Analytics</h2>
<p>Yeah. I killed it. This site Does Not Track You now. Because there's too
much of this crap online.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="fixes-fixes-fixes">
<h2>Fixes, Fixes, Fixes</h2>
<p>Too many to count...</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Fixed how logos and icons behave</li>
<li>Fixed templates in numerous places</li>
<li>Fixed bugs in image processing and copying</li>
<li>Images in <em>pages</em> now handled properly - they just weren't. At all</li>
<li>Decimals in logged times would sometimes show up to 10 digits past the decimal
point</li>
<li>...</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="silliness">
<h2>Silliness</h2>
<p>And finally, some silliness! I wrote another plugin that adds a &quot;quote of the
day&quot; at the end of each article, randomly :) Enjoy; and I hope they will
encourage you to read more articles (or at least, scroll thru them
to get to the bits of wisdom).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="and-so-v2">
<h2>And So, (v2)</h2>
<p>I got happier now.</p>
<p>I have changed the <a class="reference external" href="http://79ft.net/entries/2014-05-20-b-log/">B-Log notes</a>
to match the new setup, just so that there's one place I can send people
to in case they are interested in my setup.</p>
<p>And I'm very close to posting that damn page, but...</p>
<p><em>...of course, I am restructuring the old content and modifying old pages
instead to match what I got now, and writing stupid notes on what I did to
the thing. Because, as we all know, making yourself a tool is as, if not
more, pleasant, as using it...</em></p>

<hr class="dashed"/><p>So, originally it was supposed to be the shop <em>day</em>. I was gonna clean and
put together the compressor I picked up off a gentleman on Craigslist, and set
up the air hoses, filters and such - and then, back to CAD. And then..</p>
<p>See, I was looking for a bandsaw. I wasn't in a rush, so I was
gonna pick up a good used one; so I was watching Craigslist and such,
waiting and waiting. After doing that for about 6 months and after I got
tired of not having one; I finally said &quot;screw it&quot; and bid on one on Ebay.</p>
<p>I won it on Friday around 4pm; paid, and went home. Well; there, in my
Gmail's Inbox, was a notification from
<a class="reference external" href="http://craigwatcher.com/">CraigWatcher</a> saying that yet another bandsaw
ad was posted... I opened it up; and couldn't believe my eyes.</p>
<p>Someone was selling.. an 18 inch Grizzly saw for 250 bucks! I couldn't pass
on it; and next morning was driving back with a 300 pound beast in the back
of my car....</p>
<p>... and then, spent a week and a half cleaning it up. I polished the rust out of
the table; changed some bearings, re-cut threads on the blade tensioning
rod, added a 4 inch dust port (for whatever weird reason, Grizzly decided
not to put a dust port on this particular model).</p>
<p>It also ran on the 220, so I had to add a 220 outlet to the shop... Decided to
go all out; and added a 6 gauge run with 50 amp breaker, so that I can run
a TIG welder off of it when I get one.</p>
<p>So now; I own two bandsaws :).</p>
<p>Here's the perpetrator:</p>

<p>Right now Im set up in the garage of the old house we bought about half a year
ago. Dash (my beautiful wife) is working on designing a new house we're gonna
build; and that one is going to have a good sized shop. We will build
that house first and then demo the old house; so I could start setting
up earlier than I thought I would be able to; which is certainly nice.</p>
<p>But; Im dealing with 40 year old electrical; and other fun stuff..</p>
<p>Here are some pictures of that garage, ordered historically, as I was setting

top, bottom, and sides. All done with DAP Weldwood contact cement.</p>
<p>I bought the insert plate (though in hindsight, I should've just bought
a hunk of aluminum and made it myself).</p>
<p>It still ended up being a bit out-of-flat, so I built a leveling system into
the base (two bolts on each side are pulling the top &quot;down&quot;, screwing into holes
in the top with threaded inserts; and there are two screws pushing up on the top
in the center of each long frame side. All that allows me to work out any
non-flatness out of the top.</p>
<p>Fence is 3/4 ply; and the router sits in the box under the table. The box
has 4 inch dust fitting epoxied on it on the other side (and the fence
dust collector feeds into that fitting too).</p>

<div class="section" id="the-problem">
<h2>The Problem</h2>
<p>... was that I needed something to organize my builder's log. Being a software
engineer by trade, I didn't want to go old school with paper logs and pictures,
and whatever-random-collection-of-stuff-on-a-computer I could do. I wanted
something that's easy to add entries to, calculates everything automatically,
and allows me to publish it on the Web. Plus, I find it pleasant to view HTML
as opposed to .doc, .pdf, or whatever.</p>
<p>Being a nerd, I just had to make it as nice for myself as I could...</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-kitlog-pro">
<h2>The KitLog Pro</h2>
<p>Many-a-builder is using this apparently successful piece of work. Apparently,
as of writing this, they have over 1100 logs published on their
<a class="reference external" href="http://mykitlog.com">mykitlog.com</a>.</p>
<p>I have played around with it quite a bit. The program is trivially simple;
but I can't stand the way it's architected.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Windows only</li>
<li>Uses Access database for storage (sic!!)</li>
<li>Only three pictures per entry (really???)</li>
</ul>
<p>Oh, the Access databases. Basically, what this means to me as a user is if it
ever .. erm.. decides to stop working, I will loose all my data. &quot;Revert to a
backup&quot;, you say.. Yes, but if the problem is that I can't add my N+1st record
because the DB just corrupted itself, no backup will help -- I'm stuck.</p>
<p>On top of that if, god forbid, KitLog ever goes out of business, I am stuck
with the data that I can't export w/o some serious reverse engineering.</p>
<p>No thank you. :)</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-early-attempts">
<h2>The Early Attempts</h2>
<p>So, I was toying around with other stuff.</p>
<div class="section" id="blogspot">
<h3>BlogSpot</h3>
<p>Really cool (probably, second best to WordPress) blogging platform. Plus,
links very nicely with Picasa, making image inserts a breeze.</p>
<p>The problem? How do I track time spent?</p>
<p>Also, the &quot;going-out-of-business&quot; problem was still there...</p>
<p>Moving on...</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="a-cms-drupal-or-joomla-or-whatever-custom-plugins">
<h3>A CMS (Drupal or Joomla or whatever) + custom plugins</h3>
<p>Now, that was better. Those are open source, good content entry and organization
tools, and I can export it all out of a MySQL DB should I need to.</p>
<p>But, they require a <em>server</em>  (which means either I'm
running a server, or require hosting). And frankly, I believed that there
must be a better way...</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="sphinx">
<h3>Sphinx</h3>
<p>Close, but no cigar. <a class="reference external" href="http://sphinx-doc.org">Sphinx</a> is the documentation
framework used by Python and many others (including the company I work for).</p>
<p>It takes a bunch of ReST files as input (more on that later), and runs them
through a converter, producing whatever you want (there are writers for html,
txt, doc, pdf, and so on). The parser and converter is called
<a class="reference external" href="http://docutils.sourceforge.net/">docutils</a>.</p>
<p>The problem with Sphinx is that it's geared towards writing documentation,
and frankly, felt a bit too heavy to me for writing a builder's log.</p>
<p>While googling about yet-another-thingie-I-wanted-to-figure-out-about-Sphinx,
I stumbled upon an article that talked about static site generators. There lied
the Holy Grail....</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="mutilation-of-the-pelican">
<h2>Mutilation of the Pelican</h2>
<p>The <a class="reference external" href="http://blog.getpelican.com/">Pelican</a>. I fell in love with this thing
almost immediately. Here's what it does:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Takes a directory with a bunch of <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReStructuredText">ReST</a>, <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown">Markdown</a>, or <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asciidoc">ASCIIDOC</a></li>
<li>Parses all those files into internal state, obtaining metadata from both files and paths (ie, if you organize your files in <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">category/&lt;date&gt;/name</span></tt> way, you can tell it to properly parse that path and populate the metadata)</li>
<li>Uses  <a class="reference external" href="http://jinja.pocoo.org/">Jinja</a> templates for generating a bunch of HTML output</li>
<li>Allows plugins and custom templates</li>
<li>Is all Python!</li>
</ul>
<p>I did the initial version in 2014 (the date of this article). Then, I've spent
about a week tearing it to pieces and figuring out how it works, and
adding a few plugins to add things that I needed for the B-Log that it didn't
have. I added time tracking, changed layout, got a Bootstrap-based template
and modified it, etc.</p>
<p>In 2018, I <a class="reference external" href="http://79ft.net/entries/2018-09-25-blog-2/">fixed some suff and added a few more things</a>.</p>
<p>You be the judge of results :).</p>
<p>Here's what I've done, in the end:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>I'm writing text in ReST, so I've added the custom directive to it allowing
for 'figures'. Problem is, ReST image directive produces HTML that wasn't
much useful to present images the way I wanted them. Instead of modifying
core Pelican code, I elected to add a custom 'Figure' directive. This is
done as a Pelican plugin. This plugin also  automatically adds thumbnails
for images. This is the <tt class="docutils literal">figure_process</tt> plugin. It also requires the
<tt class="docutils literal">image_copy</tt> plugin.</li>
<li>Another plugin I've written is <tt class="docutils literal">image_copy</tt>. It enables sane handling of
images placed next to the entries (pages and articles). Back when I started
in 2014, Pelican wanted you to separate images and text (and it's internal
mechanism of  <strong>not</strong> separating them was broken back then). Pelican guys
might've fixed this in the last 3 years, but hey, my setup worked for me -
and I kept it.</li>
<li>And most importantly, the plugin that allows the bulk of functionality - the
<tt class="docutils literal">b_log</tt> plugin. It does a lot of stuff:<ul>
<li>Generates the project structure (&quot;Project / Section&quot; concept with
multiple projects)</li>
<li>Enables a special metadata tag to track time in an article</li>
<li>Loads and parses logfiles that don't have articles associated with entries</li>
<li>Calculates totals</li>
<li>Creates internal data structures for theme templates to use</li>
<li>Renders log pages</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Then came theming. Pelican is geared towards bloggers, so I had to tweak a
lot of things to be better suited for B-Logging (build logging,
remember? :) ).  In the process, I've switched to
<a class="reference external" href="http://getbootstrap.com">Bootstrap</a>, since it makes it very easy to
organize content on a webpage. I added theme templates to produce the build
logs with totals, etc, etc. Also integrated
<a class="reference external" href="http://fancybox.net/">FancyBox</a> - a really cool JavaScript image overlay.</li>
<li>I added a couple of extras for myself - like silly QuOTD messages at the
bottom of each entry - but that's not <em>strictly</em> related to B-Logging...</li>
</ul>
<p>I like the end-result. I enjoyed hacking at it, and this was the first time
I touched Python (so had to learn that on the way). Pretty neat
(though I still prefer Perl (now, why do you need lists <em>and</em> tuples
<em>and</em>  sets again? :) ).</p>
<p>The only drawback is that it's regenerating everything every time.
You can easily see how that might become a problem when you get a lot of
entries, but I'm feeling like I'm ways away. 30 pages take about a second. I
think I will need a lot of records before this becomes a problem; and at that
point I will rewrite the whole damn thing to cache stuff.. probably :)</p>
<p>The code is  <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/fidot1983/b-log">here</a>. The repo
includes my theme, plugins, some tools, and sample content. It requires Python
(I used 3.6 and did <strong>not</strong> test anything else), Pelican (which
is checked into the repo in <tt class="docutils literal">pelican/</tt>, along with it's dependencies),
and Pillow (<tt class="docutils literal">pip install pillow</tt>). Oh yeah, and <tt class="docutils literal">pelicanconf.py</tt>'s
<tt class="docutils literal">PATH_METADATA</tt> will likely require tweaking of slashes on Windows.</p>
<p>Read the config file (<tt class="docutils literal">pelicanconf.py</tt>); and read thru
<a class="reference external" href="http://docs.getpelican.com/en/stable/quickstart.html">Pelican docs</a>
to get the idea. <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">sample-content/</span></tt> contains my sample generated content
that I was testing with. <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">content-gen/</span></tt> contains the simple Perl script that
generates as much sample content as you want.</p>
<div class="section" id="how-it-works">
<h3>How it Works</h3>
<p>To me as an end-user, it looks like this.</p>
<p>My source files are organized in directories like so:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
/project-one/section-one/

        2001-01-01-entry-one/
                    entry-one.rst
                    picture.jpg

        section-one-log.log

/project-one/section-two/

        2001-01-02-entry-two/
                    entry-two.rst
                    picture.jpg

        section-two-log.log

/project-two/section-one/

        2002-01-01-entry-one/
                    entry-one.rst
                    picture.jpg

/project-two/section-two/

        2002-01-02-entry-two/
                    entry-two.rst
                    picture.jpg
</pre>
<p>and so on. Note the text <tt class="docutils literal">*.log</tt> files - those are just log entries
without the articles. They are optional, as you can see
in <tt class="docutils literal">Project Two</tt>.</p>
<p>Text log files look like this:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
2011-01-01 | Some Summary Here       | 1.02
2011-01-02 | Some Other Summary Here | 2.02
</pre>
<p>Note the separator - that's configurable :).</p>
<p>There can be as many log files in a &quot;Project/Section&quot; as one wishes, they
will all be parsed, and all entries will be  properly sorted by date.</p>
<p>There can be entire sections without articles - but a project <strong>must
have at least one article</strong> to be properly displayed. Yeah, you got
to at least declare your intentions :).</p>
<p>This directory structure will get parsed into two Projects
(<tt class="docutils literal">Project One</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">Project Two</tt>) with their separate logs.
Each project will get it's own menu on the left. To display the menus,
<tt class="docutils literal">B_LOG_PROJECTS_MENU</tt> config var should list them.</p>
<p>If there was any time logged in a project (either in article entries,
log files, or both), that project's menu will get an extra &quot;Log&quot; entry, which
will neatly display all log entries, and some totals.</p>
<p>There are a few special directories I use, <tt class="docutils literal">pages</tt> (configurable
in <tt class="docutils literal">PAGE_PATHS</tt>) for static pages
(ie, <a class="reference external" href="http://79ft.net/pages/about/">About</a> section
of this site is a static page), and <tt class="docutils literal">blog</tt>, for blog entries (they don't
show up under any projects).</p>
<p>If I want a new article-type entry, I just add a directory in the
<tt class="docutils literal">project/section</tt> path, and start writing
the article in my favorite text editor (<a class="reference external" href="http://www.vim.org">VIM!!</a>).
If I decide to log time, I just use my special <tt class="docutils literal">logged</tt> metadata entry
at the top of the article.  I drop images into article's directory, and use
my <tt class="docutils literal">figure</tt> ReST directive to reference them.</p>
<p>If I just need to log some time without polluting the Internet too much
with useless text, I add it to an appropriate <tt class="docutils literal">.log</tt> file, or
create a new one.</p>
<p>If I don't want to log time, I don't have to - I can just post an
entry into the project w/o time logged.</p>
<p>After I'm done, I run Pelican, which generates
the full website (html, images, everything!) into an output directory. Voila!
I can stop right there, and I will have a fully working local version of my
log, since it's all static HTML,
but we want this online, don't we? So, the only thing left is...</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="hosting">
<h3>Hosting</h3>
<p>This was another revelation. Apparently, <a class="reference external" href="http://github.org">GitHub</a> hosts
static pages! 'Uploading a site' is a <tt class="docutils literal">git push</tt>, and it transfers only
deltas, so no fiddling with FTP, rsync, or whatever! They allow custom domain
names instead of <tt class="docutils literal">username.github.io</tt>, all you need is to set your A records
in your DNS to point to their servers. It's awesome!</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="and-so">
<h2>And So,</h2>
<p>I am very happy with this so far. I have all my logs in  practically plain text
format, parser for which is open source and available. I have it nicely
organized, and I can back it up as I please (to GitHub, anyone? :) ). I can
re-write the programs that parse and produce final .html. I can extend the
generator and change the theme to produce a printable version of the log, styled
for paper rather than web. The list goes on!</p>
