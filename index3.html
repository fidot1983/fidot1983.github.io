<hr class="dashed"/><p>After using <a class="reference external" href="http://79ft.net/entries/2014-05-20-b-log/">the setup I did for myself in 2014</a> for a while,  I decided it was time to change things around a bit.</p>
<div class="section" id="segway">
<h2>Segway</h2>
<p><em>... so yeah. I needed to add a static page, and I had a bunch of ideas about
extra stuff I wanted to do for a while. But mostly, I just needed to add a
damn static page, and thinking about coercing the existing setup into
doing that with all the pictures I needed there was not making me happy...</em></p>
<p><em>... it was also about time I set this thing up so that I could actually
log more projects than just a single airplane. Hey, I bet we all
know - websites of this kind are mostly created to be later enjoyed by their
authors in periods of 'I ain't got nothing better to do than review
my old notes' mood ...</em></p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="multiple-projects">
<h2>Multiple Projects</h2>
<p>First of all, I wanted to be able to log multiple projects. The way the old
setup was done was it had basically one project, under the section
called &quot;Build&quot;, and then this dangling catch-all &quot;blog&quot; thing for everything
else.</p>
<p>But as you can see, most of articles here actually are NOT about the airplane
I was working on at the time - the Skybolt - but rather, other little things
here and there.</p>
<p>First thing I did, is I changed the way the files are laid out, and added
semantics converting source content's directory structure to
&quot;Project / Section&quot; semantics.</p>
<p>Each project now has it's own &quot;sub-log&quot; (that's what time logged is tracked
based on). There is still a catch-all &quot;blog&quot; section, and a &quot;default&quot;
project that can be configured if one so desires.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="logging">
<h2>Logging</h2>
<p>One more thing I realised is that the original version would only allow to log
time if it was associated with an article-type entry... Flooding the Internet
with tens of pages of &quot;built three more ribs tonight&quot; type stuff <em>just to log
time</em> seemed kinda silly, so I added support for plain text log entries.</p>
<p>Articles still can track time; but you can also now have a separate text
file with just &quot;Date&quot;, &quot;Summary&quot;, and &quot;Time Logged&quot; entries - one per line.</p>
<p>When creating the &quot;log&quot; page for a project, entries, being both
from articles and from logfiles, are sorted by date,
and then ones with articles associated with them will pick their summaries up
from articles. Entries coming from text files will be displayed with summaries
from log files.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="major-code-cleanup">
<h2>Major Code Cleanup</h2>
<p>All this time tracking functionality, structuring articles into projects, and
such, were becoming  an entity of its own large enough for me to justify
clumping it all into a single Pelican's plugin, now called &quot;b_log&quot;. I also
added a bunch of config options to set up it's behavior.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="no-google-analytics">
<h2>No Google Analytics</h2>
<p>Yeah. I killed it. This site Does Not Track You now. Because there's too
much of this crap online.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="fixes-fixes-fixes">
<h2>Fixes, Fixes, Fixes</h2>
<p>Too many to count...</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Fixed how logos and icons behave</li>
<li>Fixed templates in numerous places</li>
<li>Fixed bugs in image processing and copying</li>
<li>Images in <em>pages</em> now handled properly - they just weren't. At all</li>
<li>Decimals in logged times would sometimes show up to 10 digits past the decimal
point</li>
<li>...</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="silliness">
<h2>Silliness</h2>
<p>And finally, some silliness! I wrote another plugin that adds a &quot;quote of the
day&quot; at the end of each article, randomly :) Enjoy; and I hope they will
encourage you to read more articles (or at least, scroll thru them
to get to the bits of wisdom).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="and-so-v2">
<h2>And So, (v2)</h2>
<p>I got happier now.</p>
<p>I have changed the <a class="reference external" href="http://79ft.net/entries/2014-05-20-b-log/">B-Log notes</a>
to match the new setup, just so that there's one place I can send people
to in case they are interested in my setup.</p>
<p>And I'm very close to posting that damn page, but...</p>
<p><em>...of course, I am restructuring the old content and modifying old pages
instead to match what I got now, and writing stupid notes on what I did to
the thing. Because, as we all know, making yourself a tool is as, if not
more, pleasant, as using it...</em></p>

<hr class="dashed"/><p>In the past 7 months I have been busy building... the crib for the baby. Almost
non stop evenings, 4-6 hours a day: the result is good, but this is a &quot;Skybolt
Story&quot;, not a &quot;Bed Story&quot;: so no, I won't post all my projects here :).</p>
<p>Also, it seems like next 2-3 years will be mostly furniture building for
this guy.. Oh well.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I was able to put in a few hours into fixing up the coves in
my wingtips where all the lights are.</p>
<p>If you recall, I have made <a class="reference external" href="http://79ft.net/entries/cheetah-strobe-shields/">strobe shields</a> quite a while back, but I haven't fixed up the coves. I was waiting for the shields to be painted.</p>
<p>Well, they were during the <a class="reference external" href="http://79ft.net/entries/cgr-30/">cgr-30 install</a>,
and then I was working on the crib.. So finally, the time has come.</p>
<p>Look at what I had to start with.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/cheetah-wingtips-cleanup/wingtips-1.jpg" title="Sad sad wingtip" >

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Another sad wingtip</p><p>First, all the lights came out. The old plastic lenses went straight into the
trash bin. Then, came off the foam padding that goes in between the lens and the
wingtip.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/cheetah-wingtips-cleanup/wingtips-3.jpg" title="All opened up" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/cheetah-wingtips-cleanup/wingtips-3-thumb.jpg" title="All opened up" alt="All opened up" >

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Cleaned and sanded</p><p>I think the above was about an hour of sanding. All old paint came off. Also,
the broken rivnut went out (did you notice it? That extra hole was what someone
has drilled and used a sheet metal screw to &quot;fix&quot; it instead of drilling out
the broken rivnut).</p>
<p>Finally, masked with the first set of masking tape. I was set to repaint the
coves.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/cheetah-wingtips-cleanup/wingtips-5.jpg" title="Masking the edges" >

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Masking the edges</p><p>The other wingtip was even worse. The cove itself had a huge &quot;dip&quot; in it.
Also, some &quot;genius&quot; decided to screw #10 screws straight into the fiberglass...
Some threads were all torn up, and I decided to install rivnuts all around
to make sure the tips match.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/cheetah-wingtips-cleanup/wingtips-6.jpg" title="Just disassembled, note the large dip in the nav light area" >

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Fitting holes in the strobe shield</p><p>And we're ready with the second one.</p>
<p>Now, I wanted to clean up the nav lights housing as well. Originally I wanted to paint both cover and base, but once I cleaned up the base, I decided to leave it as is: apparently, it was nice and shiny after all that 40 year old corrosion
cleaned off of it!</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Came out nice after painting!</p><p>Then, final masking, and painting. Damn! That didn't go so well. I didn't
notice a fairly small dip in the other tip's cove, and the Bondo'd one got some
pinholes. Time was running very short so I ended up leaving that as is.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/cheetah-wingtips-cleanup/wingtips-15.jpg" title="Right wingtip cove, painted. See the dip now?" >

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Left tip. That one with pinholes :(</p><p>Once the paint was all dry came the time for fitting the foam padding and
lenses. And here, I made a fatal mistake: I have installed the padding <em>first</em>. That makes fitting of the lens virtually impossible (at least, for me).</p>
<p>That had produced an unsightly gap of about 1/8 inches. Oh god! I had no spare lenses, and I <em>had</em> to put the plane back together not to screw my partner who needed the plane soon. Very soon.</p>
<p>... I ended up screwing him anyway 'cause somewhere in the middle of me fitting
that first lens Max was born and I was knocked out for 5 days ...</p>
<p>... just in case you're wondering: 7lbs 11oz, 20 inches, June 25, 2015, 10:35 am ...</p>
<p>... I still haven't had any chance to get another lens, so I decided to put it back together as is as a memory of me being stupid. Maybe I'll buy another set from Ken in another year or two; and also fix all the dips and pinholes ...</p>

<hr class="dashed"/><p>I'm done with my longest airplane project so far! No, it's not for the Skybolt, it's for my Cheetah. But it's an important one and was a great fun to tackle.</p>
<p>So, without further adieu...</p>
<p>The Cheetah never had an engine analyzer -- and I elected to get one, full blown, replacing all the standard engine gauges. I ended up picking the <a class="reference external" href="http://buy-ei.com/portfolio/cgr-30p-overview/">EI's CGR-30P</a> because of it's roundness, compactness, and me generally liking EI a lot.</p>
<p>So, late August, it was Christmas. I got the box, that had a lot of boxes, with boxes, and boxes inside -- lots of stuff. Probes, aggregator box, wires...</p>
<p>First thing I did was put everything together on my dining table, just to make sure I understand the wire-up and that it works. I have even blown into the fuel transducer and was satisfied seeing it registering some &quot;flow&quot;.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/cgr-30/00-cgr30.jpg" title="On the bench" >

 </a> <p class="small text-center">On the bench</p><p>And then, the install. The problem was, I also wanted to fly in between, so I had to plan the install in stages and make sure the airplane's flyable in between.</p>
<div class="section" id="session-1">
<h2>Session 1</h2>
<p>First thing was running two out of three wire harnesses thru the firewall (all temp probes, and all pressure and flow transducers). I found a spot on the inside of the firewall for the box, and made sure I had enough length to run to the &quot;aggregator&quot; box.</p>

<h2>Session 2</h2>
<p>I was planning to fly out to friend's hangar and work on the probes install there. The luck did not cooperate -- very sluggish pull-thru on the engine start and heavy discharge right after on the ammeter hinted at the alternator failure.</p>
<p>Sure enough, it was. I ended up unbuttoning the cowl at the FBO I was hangaring at.</p>

<h2>Session 6</h2>
<p>Finally, back to the hangar! This session took 2 days actually :). It was the time to install, wire up, re-position all the gauges on the panel, and such.</p>
<p>The old CHT, EGT and hobbs were to go. Clock was to be relocated to the position it's visible at (it was right under the panel eyebrow before). Davtron OAT/PALT/DALT/Volts gauge was to be relocated to another spot in the panel to free up space for CGR-30 auxiliary panel I made in the previous session. And, most of wireup had to be done. Harnesses connected to the box, ran to the display, and power.</p>

<p>Thoughts about grounding something I shouldn't have grounded (ie, a plead) cross my mind. Then, thoughts about a loose screw somewhere next to the ignition switch crosses my mind.</p>
<p>I re-try. Same thing. Engine starts, runs a few seconds, and dies off. WHAAA??!</p>
<p>... I decide to go take a bathroom break. On the way back, another thought crosses my mind.... I get back, practically running, get into the plane - and sure enough! Fuel selector is &quot;off&quot;. I switched it off the day before, before getting behind the panel. Just in case :) Phew.</p>
<p>The &quot;right mag&quot; problem doesn't go away though. I start diagnosing -- touching input wires to different pegs on the ignition key -- no matter which mag it is, &quot;left&quot; is okay and &quot;right&quot; is dead. Uneasy thoughts about a dead wire in the harness and having to undo the whole thing start crowding me... But, I decide to dig a bit deeper. Success!</p>
<p>Can you spot the problem?</p>

<h2>Session 7</h2>
<p>It was that time to go to Fletcher's and continue working on it there. Plus, my new wheelpants were ready!</p>
<p>Before I went though, I had to make one last missing bit. A bracket for the ammeter shunt. Did that at the home shop; and did it in a couple different widths to see which one fits better. That bracket was supposed to plug the hole left after old engine gauges removal, and hold the shunt.</p>
<p>By the way, I decided to wire the shunt into the battery leads. First of all, that's how Grummans are wired by default; and second, it actually shows you the actual discharge when you're on battery -- a good thing! It doesn't show the true load when charging the battery though -- just the charge current. That's okay though, as long as charge current remains <em>positive</em> I know my alt is okay.</p>

<div class="section" id="and-so">
<h2>And so</h2>
<p>I suppose I have to give some final thoughts.</p>
<p>Here's what I like about the gauge:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Compact, takes only one hole.</li>
<li>Not square! I hate square display engine analyzers. Don't fit right into the steam panels.</li>
<li>Good documentation. Sometimes missing details like torques, but otherwise good.</li>
<li>Great packaging and wiring harness pre-setup! Each wire came with a little sleeve identifying it. Didn't ever need to look at the harnesses diagram for wire-up.</li>
<li>Great software and setup.</li>
<li>Great support.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here's what I didn't like:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Single-stranded, unprotected wires for the probes</li>
<li>The fact that I had to run the harness into the box, and then connect the box to the display. In my case, it made the wires longer, since they had to run from the in-hole in the middle of the firewall to the side where the box was mounted. Would've been easier to go straight to the display. I discussed this with EI actually; and they said that that was a long debated issue -- and they opted for the box, since that setup helps guys that have their engines far from panels (twins for example). I understand this rationale.</li>
<li>#8 mounting holes on the &quot;aggregator box&quot; with countersunk screws. Would've been much easier if they had a #10 holes for AN3 bolts.</li>
<li>Quality of OLP-1 barrel connectors. Very sharp plastic edges. I wasn't comfortable tying them to the wires just like that and had to hand-deburr all of them.</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, I love it. Great gauge, and I will be putting that on the Skybolt! :)</p>

<hr class="dashed"/><p>No posts about the Skybolt doesn't mean that there was nothing done :). Yessir!</p>
<p>I was redrawing pretty much everything I did in the first few months of modeling the lower wing; and that ate up a bunch of time and didn't actually produce anything to show. But damn, did it suck up time!</p>
<p>I ended up re-doing:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Spars</li>
<li>All ribs</li>
<li>Full wing assembly (now it's clean and easy to tweak)</li>
<li>A lot of compression plates</li>
<li>Complete aileron assembly</li>
</ul>
<p>Especially with ribs, the problem was that I did them while learning SolidWorks -- which led me to sketching them in AutoCad first (I used to hate doing curves in SWX.. now I hate Autocad, but that's another story :)). That made them virtually un-tweakable; and &quot;tweaking&quot; the verticals, which I <a class="reference external" href="http://79ft.net/entries/2014-09-01/">had to do after confirming drag wire interference</a>, proved to be virtually impossible.</p>
<p>So, I decided to clean it all up. Oh yeah, and I have moved that interfering vertical.</p>
<p>The brand-spanking new set of ribs:</p>

<p>I started with a &quot;placeholder&quot; that was the inboard (full size) butt rib. Then, using the tip bow, I drew a couple of &quot;guide curves&quot; and projected it on a couple planes, corresponding to ribs, giving me two different profiles.</p>

<hr class="dashed"/><p>No Skybolt news, you say?</p>
<p>Well, with dead alternator, tons of work, and unfinished install of a gauge that
is supposed to keep you informed about your engine, not much time for the Bolt.</p>
<p>Oh well.</p>
<p>I love to fly at night. It's just something out of a different world, something... else.</p>
<p>There are a few things that are extremely important at night. Most importantly, the old &quot;See and be seen&quot; rule.</p>
<p>To be seen, you need blinking lights on your airplane, nav lights, ideally a landing light, and such.</p>
<p>To see, you need to retain your night vision. That means, no bright white or any color light besides something like red or blue. Otherwise, your eyes readjust for &quot;daylight&quot;, and you are at good odds of not seeing other blinking lights... like the ones on an airplane you might fly into!</p>
<p>You see, I don't have strobe shields on my plane. Take a look at the picture below, and imagine you sitting in the cabin.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/cheetah-strobe-shields/strobe-shields.jpg" title="Strobe Shields on a Grumman" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/cheetah-strobe-shields/strobe-shields-thumb.jpg" title="Strobe Shields on a Grumman" alt="Strobe Shields on a Grumman" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Strobe Shields on a Grumman</p><p>You see that vertical little metal &quot;fin&quot; I circled? That's what blocks you from seeing the strobe - a bright flashing white light. If that metal fin is not there, you basically get blinded every second or so.</p>
<p>It's so bad I ended up flying with strobes turned off a couple times I was up after dark. I figured, just one beacon on the tail and no strobes is better than a blind pilot.</p>
<p>And especially now, when the weather in Texas is so nice and night flying is just calling and calling and calling, that became a priority project.</p>
<p>So, on to it!</p>
<p>Those shields go under the wing tip light cluster lens, and the spot they're supposed to go into is curved. Shields themselves are nothing but a curved L - angle out of aluminum.</p>
<p>So, I needed a stretcher.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/cheetah-strobe-shields/02.jpg" title="The Stretcher" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/cheetah-strobe-shields/02-thumb.jpg" title="The Stretcher" alt="The Stretcher" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">The Stretcher</p><p>Prepared one of the wingtips:</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/cheetah-strobe-shields/01.jpg" title="Wingtip light cluster with the spot where the shield goes cleaned up." >

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Wingtip light cluster with the spot where the shield goes cleaned up.</p><p>First, I decided to make a test piece to get some practice. Never used a stretcher before.</p>
<p>We start with a simple L-angle. I used 6061-T4, 0.025 thick.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Close enough for a prototype.</p><p>You can see on the pictures that the stretcher leaves pretty deep &quot;scratches&quot;. On the prototype, I tried sanding them out -- only to get my metal turn paper thin.</p>
<p>On the real one, I decided to fill them up with Bondo.</p>
<p>So, bought some, and made myself a pattern too -- which I printed full size.</p>
<p>To do that, asked Adam, the guy who bought my 28797's share (thanks again, man!) to take some pictures of strobe shield on his Tiger.</p>
<p>And then, just drew around it in Solid Works. Turned out nice.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/cheetah-strobe-shields/swx-sketch.jpg" title="Sketching around the photo in SWX." >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/cheetah-strobe-shields/swx-sketch-thumb.jpg" title="Sketching around the photo in SWX." alt="Sketching around the photo in SWX." >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Sketching around the photo in SWX.</p><p>Note the tape measure above -- I first drew a line 6 inches long and scaled the photo until that line matched 6 inches on the tape measure. This way I ensured proper scale.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Drawing of the part for the patterns.</p><p>So with those patterns printed out, I went to town.</p>
<p>First thing I noticed is that curvature on the wingtip I was working on doesn't match the pattern :). Of course. They're all different (and by the way, on the other wingtip it matched perfectly. Go figure.). I wanted the pattern to primarily get the general shape right.</p>
<p>So, here I am stretching my L shaped angle, and... SNAP!</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">:(</p><p>So now, bend another L angle, deburr, clean up, size... sigh.. I went much much slower...</p>
<p>I think, getting it perfect took around 3 hours of careful work. That curve gets aggressive towards the end. And, when I was almost done.. snap! I tore it up again, this time the very tip.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/cheetah-strobe-shields/06.jpg" title="Damn!" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/cheetah-strobe-shields/06-thumb.jpg" title="Damn!" alt="Damn!" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Damn!</p><p>Luckily, it actually still was long enough (I started with a piece longer than necessary), so I was able to get away with this tear. Phew.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Cut to about the right size</p><p>Next, came a lot of sanding, filing, and emery-clothing to get it to the right shape. And then, the holes.</p>
<p>Those had to be duplicated and match up with the existing holes in the wingtip, so I made a simple hole duplicator. No, I'm not paying 10 bucks for that thing!</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Prep</p><p>Notice that this one has rivnuts and not just holes. I now have a theory why this plane is missing strobe shields.</p>
<p>I think the guy who tore all the threads in the fiberglass wingtip and installed those rivnuts (remember, the other one doesn't have them?), was too lazy and didn't want to tweak the holes in the strobe shields to match with the rivnuts. That's my guess.</p>
<p>Initially, I thought about making oversized holes in the shield, but that would put one of them too close to the edge. Then, I tried filing the rivnut down a bit, but decided that I'm not gaining much there, and that notching the strobe shield base would be best. That's what I ended up doing.</p>
<p>I made just the first notch, and to stretching it was!</p>

I'll have to clean up the rest of black tape from under the wingtip lenses and replace them with new ones, but that'll come after painting the shields.

<p>And you know what.. that was fun!</p>

<hr class="dashed"/><p>No posts for 1 month and 5 days! Holy cow.</p>
<p>That's all been eaten up by a couple projects. One of them ended up being a complete redraw of all airfoil sections on the lower wings on the Skybolt; and nothing to write about (no pretty pictures, very routine work). Just lots and lots of cleanup.</p>
<p>Another one... was me following an old Russian tradition.</p>
<p>You see, during long winter months Russians' desire for fruit and vegetables (and mushrooms) is satisfied with pickled everything. Cucumbers, tomatoes, cabbage, grape leaves, dill (!), apples, garlic, fish (haha :) ), and other things which I don't know English words for.</p>
<p>My genes are calling. It's fall, and I had to pickle me something.</p>
<p>It was.. a disassembled Lycoming for the Skybolt!</p>
<p>Some weeks ago, a gentleman posted on the Forum about him selling an O-360-A4M, all overhauled, yellowtagged, and such, by Superior; with higher compression pistons from ECI, with everything needed to put it together minus the sump and accessories, for a very attractive price.</p>
<p>Best part was, it was disassembled, so I am to get all the fun putting it together without the disassembling and sending parts out for overhaul (and well, paying for that too :)).</p>
<p>In short, it was a great deal.</p>
<p>The problem? Well, I will not need it for quite a while. 10 years maybe, if I go with the speed I'm currently going at.</p>
<p>I figured, assembling and pickling it after would be a bad proposition. A much better one would be to pickle it part by part.</p>
<p>As usual, started with a <a class="reference external" href="http://www.biplaneforum.com/showthread.php?t=10628">thread on the Biplane Forum</a>.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, I ended up using three things.</p>

It's mineral spirits soluble, moisture displacing spray-on stuff that can protect up to 2 years in outside (!!!) storage.

<p>It sprays on, and then dries over a couple days to consistency of candlewax. A bit sticky, but very tough. They claim it's scratch resistant.</p>
<p>Just in case I missed something or ended up scratching it off; I decided to also put a thick layer of Aeroshell grease on everything that's covered with CorrShield. Just in case.</p>
<p>And then...</p>

<hr class="dashed"/><p>So on the Cheetah side, I am slowly ramping up for replacing all the engine gauges that I currently have on the panel with the <a class="reference external" href="buy-ei.com/portfolio/cgr-30p-overview/">CGR-30</a>. I got it at Oshkosh, and finally, the box arrived a couple weeks ago.</p>
<p>Ain't she a beauty? Assembled on the bench for testing and familiarizing myself with it :)</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2014-03-09-sheet-metal/cgr30.jpg" title="Ain't she a beauty?" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2014-03-09-sheet-metal/cgr30-thumb.jpg" title="Ain't she a beauty?" alt="Ain't she a beauty?" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Ain't she a beauty?</p><p>Because of it, I will lose a few 2 1/4 inch round gauges, and I decided to make some covers for the panel, not to have unsightly holes in it.</p>
<p>Of course I could've bought them from Spruce or whatever, 5 bucks a pop, but if you know me, I would rather spend hours making something I can make. Besides, this is a nice first sheet metal exercise :). And, I wanted a nice domed bulge on each one of them. Just Flat wasn't enough.</p>
<p>So, I got to it.</p>
<p>First iteration was making a jig that would sandwich the sheet between two boards, with holes over and under the metal. Then, I would press a &quot;piston&quot; thru the holes using my vice as a press. Pictures are better than a thousand words.</p>
<p>Three piece jig + soon-to-be-'piston'. Oak boards sandwich the sheet between them. Ply plate has the &quot;piston&quot; and is used as a backing plate for it.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2014-03-09-sheet-metal/jig-1-1.jpg" title="Jig pieces" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2014-03-09-sheet-metal/jig-1-1-thumb.jpg" title="Jig pieces" alt="Jig pieces" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Jig pieces</p><p>That didn't work out. Vice jaws are not perfectly parallel, and the &quot;piston&quot; is not exactly the same diameter as the holes -- so it gets misaligned, even though there are four guiding bolts in the corners... Here's the jig assembled, and one of the first tries.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2014-03-09-sheet-metal/jig-1-2.jpg" title="First try..." >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2014-03-09-sheet-metal/jig-1-2-thumb.jpg" title="First try..." alt="First try..." >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">First try...</p><p>I think I tried it two or three times, with the same result.. no matter how much I tried to align the &quot;piston&quot;, it would make a bit more pressure on one side of the jig than on the other, either resulting in a tear, or in an uneven &quot;bulge&quot;.</p>
<p>Out of desperation, I took a piece of metal, laid it over one of the holes in the oak jig board, and started banging away - and was surprised! I was getting almost what I wanted, just not clean enough.</p>
<p>I tried sandwiching the metal between two plates and banging via the top hole - and made a fairly nice bulge! The edges weren't very clean, but I reasoned that if I opened the top hole up a bit more, that would give me access to the edge, and I will be able to bang on the edge a bit more, defining it better.</p>
<p>Ha! No. Same stuff.. I was able to make a fairly nice bulge, but the edge will be all &quot;torn&quot; and ugly.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Bulge is there, but the edge is god awful</p><p>I also tried putting a profile on the bottom, &quot;die&quot; plate of the jig, with a very sharp edge and curvature under it.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">The Two Hammers</p><p>So I gave up, and emailed Bill Rose, the gentleman who gave me all the
SolidWorks parts for standard HW, and, in general, helps me a bunch with my
silly SWX and other questions, for advice.</p>
<p>Bill suggested using MDF for the jig instead of oak. Apparently, irregularities in wood grain would make it hard to define the edges <em>uniformely</em>. He also suggested using corking tools akin a big &quot;chisel&quot; on the edges to better define them.</p>
<p>..and.. it worked!</p>
<p>The third jig is ugly, but it works. Upper hole is enlarged just to get access to the edges (I didn't bother making the top hole concentric with the bottom or even round; there was no need).</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">The third jig</p><p>I used the two-headed plastic/rubber hammer's rubber head as a corking tool, lightly hitting it with the plastic mallet, and having it slide from the edge into the center of the bulge.</p>
<p>This bulge still has some &quot;orange peel&quot; on it and needs to be smoothed out, but the edges are very well defined!</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2014-03-09-sheet-metal/good.jpg" title="Check out those edges!" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2014-03-09-sheet-metal/good-thumb.jpg" title="Check out those edges!" alt="Check out those edges!" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Check out those edges!</p><p>But of course, I screwed up again - the hole in the bottom, &quot;die&quot; plate of the jig, is of a wrong diameter (I used the wrong holesaw). But hey, at least I think I figured that technique out!</p>

<p>Thanks to <a class="reference external" href="http://www.biplaneforum.com/showthread.php?t=10493">my original post on drag wire blocks interference in the aileron bay</a>, and the picture Ward
posted in that thread, I figured the wires pattern out. Switching it
around made for much better clearance!</p>
<p>Also, my original problem with aileron interfering with the drag wire blocks
is apparently no problem at all - I'll just relieve them (rasp, file, sandpaper, whatever) to provide clearance.</p>
<p>So, here's what the wing looks like right now:</p>

<h2>Aileron Bay and Drag Wires</h2>
<p>... and then, something I spent quite a number of hours on. You see, I want to
sheet the inside of the aileron bay with curved piece of 1/16th plywood, supported on braces joining ends of the ribs together.</p>
<p>A few pictures below show the idea:</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Aileron Bay Sheeting, showing the support brace.</p><p>This is all very rough. The problem though was this.</p>
<p>Here's how it looks from the wing tip side:</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Aileron Well, zoomed in.</p><p>See that clearance??? 7/64ths between the aileron tip and the nut! So even
before I started figuring out the best spline curve for that sheeting, it was obvious that it won't clear... 1/16th ply + 1/16th gap is already a 1/8th, or 8/64ths!</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.biplaneforum.com/showthread.php?t=10493">Asked the Biplane Forum folk in the same thread...</a> And, separately, actually figured it out - it was suggested to use two thin jam nuts there instead of a thin + regular nyloc.</p>
<p>That cleared a lot of space up!</p>

   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2014-09-01/well-clearance-thumb.jpg" title="Finally, some clearance!" alt="Finally, some clearance!" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Finally, some clearance!</p><p>I was thinking about modifying the tails of the wing ribs in the bay area to support this sheeting.. But, even with thin jam nuts, the bay is still very tight. Given that I won't be able to build exactly to perfect dimensions, I finally decided not to bother, and just build in place (and then we'll see what clearance I really will be able to get :)</p>
<p>Backup plan? Have some drag wire hardware protrude into the bay, and sheeting be not &quot;in front of it&quot;, but somewhat behind it (closer to the main wing spar).  <a class="reference external" href="http://www.biplaneforum.com/showpost.php?p=103052&amp;postcount=17">Something like this.</a></p>
<p>And with that, I moved on to</p>

<div class="section" id="cleaning-a-lot-of-things-up">
<h2>Cleaning a lot of things up</h2>
<p>Added all the hardware to the aileron hinges. Cleaned up most of the compression plates (doublers) to go around the compression struts and drag wires.</p>
<p>Oh, and apparently, my aileron hinges were drawn a bit wrong (and had that unsightly early model of Fafnir rod end I have thrown together). Fixed that. Made them pretty green color to celebrate the occasion :).</p>

<h2>Interference</h2>
<p>As I expected. Drag wires don't clear rib's diagonals in some places.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Station 24 vertical and diagonal interference.</p><p>Hale Wallace in his notes suggested to relocate station 24 vertical to 23 3/4, 1/4 inch forward (or &quot;left&quot; in the above picture). This will make the diagonal more steep, and clear the drag wires. I'll have to do that.</p>
<p>Another nasty. I was ready for this, and, sure enough, the bellcrank/idler pushrod doesn't clear the compression struts. The idler will have to be made lower; Steen bends them downward and I will see if I can avoid that by just moving it down a bit (and moving the idler arm down on it's bushing).</p>

<div class="section" id="ribs">
<h2>Ribs</h2>
<p>So, I started looking at relocating that vertical first.</p>
<p>My ribs' models are the first ones I did in Solid Works; and they <em>suck</em>. They are made off of sketches created from converted AutoCAD files, with lots of ugly things in them. They are practically unmodifiable. Back then I thought it was easier to draw things in AutoCAD and import them to SWX - oh, what an idiot I was :).</p>
<p>Also, while looking at things, it became clear that they also are not sitting right on spars (not symmetrical to spars' center plane basically).</p>
<p>It feels like I will end up re-drawing them from scratch, and doing them as proper assemblies this time. We'll see.</p>
<p>It might well be that <a class="reference external" href="http://79ft.net/entries/2014-05-21/">the problem I was having with aileron-to-other-ribs-alignment</a> will go away, and no holes will need to be relocated...</p>
<p>It's annoying, but at this time I am so much better with SWX than back a year ago when I was doing ribs. Still, Le Sigh.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="aileron-tip-rib-wing-tip-rib-and-tip-bow">
<h2>Aileron Tip Rib, Wing Tip Rib, and Tip Bow</h2>
<p>I've been putting this off, since those tip ribs are not dimensioned on the plans, and aren't a standard airfoil. They're supposed to create a nice transition from the main wing panel into the tip bow, creating some nice curvature.</p>
<p>I had the wing tip rib drawn up approximately, just as a placeholder.</p>
<p>Yesterday, I did an approximate aileron tip rib as well. Cutting it out of the plan and super-imposing two patters on one another helped! Plans are off (dimensions marked on them are not matching the dimensions measured off of them), but at least they're off uniformly within  one sheet; allowing me to do this.  It shows what's where.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2014-09-01/tip-rib-cutout.jpg" title="Tip Rib, cut out - finally, some physical work on the "plane"!" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2014-09-01/tip-rib-cutout-thumb.jpg" title="Tip Rib, cut out - finally, some physical work on the "plane"!" alt="Tip Rib, cut out - finally, some physical work on the "plane"!" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Tip Rib, cut out - finally, some physical work on the "plane"!</p><p>Well, for one, it became obvious that the top aileron skin on the leading edge will have to create a compound curve going to the tip rib.</p>
<p>Searching thru the Forum, and reading things showed that apparently it's not that big of a problem. Gradual gluing and lots of clamping pressure should solve that one. :)</p>
<p>And then, there's the overall tip rib shape.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2014-09-01/bow.jpg" title="Overall setup." >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2014-09-01/bow-thumb.jpg" title="Overall setup." alt="Overall setup." >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Overall setup.</p><p>This is all very early with no &quot;trimming cuts&quot; made, obviously.</p>
<p>If you think about it, the aileron tip rib is supposed to be a bit &quot;beefier&quot; (&quot;taller&quot;) than the wing tip rib. The tail of the aileron tip rib in the place where it's touching the bow should be 3/4 inches tall (so that it's flush with the bow).</p>
<p>All that will create nice smooth &quot;flow&quot; of curves from the last &quot;full size&quot; airfoil section (created by the wing rib and the aileron rib) into the tip ribs and tip bow.</p>
<p>So, first thing I'm not sure about is how good my tip rib (wing rib that is) is. I think the aileron tip rib should &quot;play off&quot; the wing tip rib's shape... In fact, if you lay a straightedge between the tip rib and the aileron rib with aileron positioned at 0 degree deflection, moving that straightedge should define the form of the aileron tip rib. I will do just that, later, lofting the surface that will &quot;cut&quot; the aileron tip rib out (and use a real straightedge with some sandpaper glued to it to shape the actual aileron's tip rib). I love it how CADing makes you think about these things!</p>
<p>But! That requires me to have a nice wing tip rib. Which I don't have. So to that task then, first.</p>
<p>Skybolt plans have the general outline and no grid on them. It's not a standard airfoil. Hmmm...</p>
<p>Last time I did it, I took dimensions off of plans. It turned out a bit off shape-wise if compared visually to the plans, so I tweaked it a bit. I still don't like that tip rib.</p>
<p>To the Firebolt!</p>
<p>Firebolt, by the way, is Skybolt, &quot;improved&quot; (and by that I mean added weight). Fuselage is a few inches longer, and hardware is all different; but basic wing design and overall things are the same. It makes it a great reference to read thru and see how things are done there.</p>
<p>Firebolt's wing tip rib is located at the same station as Skybolt's. That gives me some hope :).</p>
<p>Firebolt plans are also off (print dimensions not matching actual on sheets), but at least they have the grid -- amount of error accumulated over 1 inch of measurment hopefully is negligible. We'll have to see.</p>
