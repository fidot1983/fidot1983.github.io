<hr class="dashed"/><p>Started modeling just the very basics of the torque tube. The idea is to hang
it on the fuse, attach the aileron pushrods to it, and check clearances in the
wings (and finally get to start making them! :)).</p>
<p>Just a few screenshots today. Lots of time spent reading plans (haven't
paid as much attention to Fuselage / Control Stick setup as I did to the
wings).</p>
<p>Gladly, I had the truss model from way back when (I did it to learn SolidWorks
Weldments feature).</p>
<p>Anyways, pretty pictures below.</p>

<hr class="dashed"/><p>In the past couple of evenings; have continued hanging virtual control system
on the virtual wings.</p>
<p>Thanks to CWilliamRose from Biplane Forum, I now have quite a bit of models
of AN / MILSPEC bearings.. REP3H5 included, but he didn't have REP4H6, so that
had to be done first..</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2014-06-09/rep4h6.jpg" title="REP4H6 bearing model" >

 </a> <p class="small text-center">REP4H6 bearing model</p><p>Couldn't find a few dimensions; but my rationale is as long as the basic
eye height / bore / shank are there, and the ball 'rotates', that's good
enough for the purpose of my alignment checking, for now at least. Ill
revisit if I start getting into tight corners.</p>
<p>Next, hung the Idler, bearings, cleaned up the model (funny, lower wing
assembly is technically my <em>first</em> serious SolidWorks model, so I keep cleaning
it up as I go, killing stupid things I did back when I didn't know any better).</p>
<p>Sigh... I will need to hang the wing onto the fuselage model to make sure the
pushrod doesn't hit verticals -- clearance is there, but might not be enough.</p>
<p>Here's the wing model with the pushrod:</p>

<hr class="dashed"/><p>So, originally it was supposed to be the shop <em>day</em>. I was gonna clean and
put together the compressor I picked up off a gentleman on Craigslist, and set
up the air hoses, filters and such - and then, back to CAD. And then..</p>
<p>See, I was looking for a bandsaw. I wasn't in a rush, so I was
gonna pick up a good used one; so I was watching Craigslist and such,
waiting and waiting. After doing that for about 6 months and after I got
tired of not having one; I finally said &quot;screw it&quot; and bid on one on Ebay.</p>
<p>I won it on Friday around 4pm; paid, and went home. Well; there, in my
Gmail's Inbox, was a notification from
<a class="reference external" href="http://craigwatcher.com/">CraigWatcher</a> saying that yet another bandsaw
ad was posted... I opened it up; and couldn't believe my eyes.</p>
<p>Someone was selling.. an 18 inch Grizzly saw for 250 bucks! I couldn't pass
on it; and next morning was driving back with a 300 pound beast in the back
of my car....</p>
<p>... and then, spent a week and a half cleaning it up. I polished the rust out of
the table; changed some bearings, re-cut threads on the blade tensioning
rod, added a 4 inch dust port (for whatever weird reason, Grizzly decided
not to put a dust port on this particular model).</p>
<p>It also ran on the 220, so I had to add a 220 outlet to the shop... Decided to
go all out; and added a 6 gauge run with 50 amp breaker, so that I can run
a TIG welder off of it when I get one.</p>
<p>So now; I own two bandsaws :).</p>
<p>Here's the perpetrator:</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">The Bandsaw</p><p>Since we're talking shop....</p>
<p>Right now Im set up in the garage of the old house we bought about half a year
ago. Dash (my beautiful wife) is working on designing a new house we're gonna
build; and that one is going to have a good sized shop. We will build
that house first and then demo the old house; so I could start setting
up earlier than I thought I would be able to; which is certainly nice.</p>
<p>But; Im dealing with 40 year old electrical; and other fun stuff..</p>
<p>Here are some pictures of that garage, ordered historically, as I was setting
up.</p>

<p>Air setup is very simple, a compressor with a shutoff directly into an air
filter, regulator, and 25 feet of hose on a reel. That reaches pretty much
everywhere.</p>

thousandths - no wonder why it was all vibrating when drilling deep holes!</p>
<p>Grizzly includes very cheap chucks and arbors with their presses... Gladly,
the bearings have no play though. I ended up picking up a used Jacobs chuck
on Ebay, and boy, what a world of difference! Used a SouthBend arbor picked
up on Amazon.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">The Jacobs Chuck</p><p>I wanted a router table; but didn't want to pay around a grand for the one
I like (and cheap ones are just.. crap, honestly); so I built one.</p>
<p>Top is two sheets of 3/4 MDF, laminated together.  White Formica is laminated on
top, bottom, and sides. All done with DAP Weldwood contact cement.</p>
<p>I bought the insert plate (though in hindsight, I should've just bought
a hunk of aluminum and made it myself).</p>
<p>It still ended up being a bit out-of-flat, so I built a leveling system into
the base (two bolts on each side are pulling the top &quot;down&quot;, screwing into holes
in the top with threaded inserts; and there are two screws pushing up on the top
in the center of each long frame side. All that allows me to work out any
non-flatness out of the top.</p>
<p>Fence is 3/4 ply; and the router sits in the box under the table. The box
has 4 inch dust fitting epoxied on it on the other side (and the fence
dust collector feeds into that fitting too).</p>

<hr class="dashed"/><p>It's almost 5 am and Im finally done with the bellcrank alignment! Phew.</p>
<p>By the way, sheet metal stuff in Solid Works is amazing! You give it the
bend lines, radii, and a couple more parameters; and it automatically creates
both the bent item; as well as the flat pattern. Print the pattern, glue,
and start bending -- it will show you which line, how many degrees, and in which
direction to bend. Ill post one of those final drawings later, when I get
around to printing them and bending some actual metal :).</p>
<p>Anyway...</p>
<p>The night started quite jolly with me whipping out the idler arm with it's
bracket. Looks pretty neat, eh?</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Aileron Idler Arm and Bracket</p><p>And then, back to the bellcrank hell. I had it modeled back in the days,
and the &quot;jog&quot; bend 1/2 inches down made. Here's how busy the sketch with all
the radii and holes looks BTW; pre-bending.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Bellcrank layout</p><p>Anyway, with all the sheet metal awesomeness SolidWorks doesn't know how to
twist. You can twist a model by using deformation, but at that point all
kinds of shenanigans begin to happen. For example, all faces of the model
stop being planar faces (meaning nothing can be sketched on them, and sketch
is how you start defining a feature (part of the model)); for some reason I
wasn't able to put a reference
point into the center of one of the holes, etc. (I ended up drawing that
point finally by projecting that hole's centerline onto one of the faces;
that <em>did</em> work for whatever the weird reason Solid Works gods must have).</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Bellcrank, bent and twisted</p><p>And after fiddling with it for about an hour, I was finally able to position
everything. The plans don't specify where the bracket should be, so my educated
and logical (yes, mr. Spock?) guess was that it should be so that the aileron
pushrod connecting bellcrank to the alieron hinge is aligned and straight in the
&quot;aileron neutral&quot; position. So I used the aileron hinge center as the
reference; squared the bellcrank and aligned it that way. Note the blue
line (that's actually a plane bisecting the aileron
hinge), and the Point1 (that's that wretched point on the twisted surface
that took me so long to figure out). That's what I used for alignment.</p>

with rib truss throughout the full range of motion. I strongly suspect that I
will need the control stick's model on the fuse to do that, since that's what
the other end of that pushrod attaches to. Oh man... gotta love those
dependencies. That just means that I will have to do that model earlier than
planned. Oh well. I like Solid Works anyways...</p>

<hr class="dashed"/><p>Today, got only about an hour and a half for CADing. Re-opened my Lower Wing
model, 50% thru or so, and started remembering things and checking
things around.</p>
<p>I was right at a point when I hung the ailerons on the wings, and this time
was re-checking the alignment again, only to find that they were off! Looked
like they were lower than the rest of the wing ribs, by about 1/16th.
Clearly visible on the screenshot below.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Black lines are aileron outline, orange lines are wing ribs</p><p>Started digging around and re-checking the hinges, holes, etc, with plans. The
'spar' side hinges are the most complex ones, and they were fine.. When checking
the aileron assembly though, noticed this, which struck me as odd (and a bit
illogical):</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Aileron hinge sticking a bit 'above' the spar</p><p>Notice it sticking up? 3/32nds! Close to 1/16th. Arguably, there will be the
filler there, but it still seems illogical (yes, mr Spock? :) ).</p>
<p>Anyways, moving the spar attach holes on the hinge up by 1/16ths (plans call
for 3/8ths between the top of the hinge and the top hole center), so 5/16ths
it is. That moved the whole aileron up on the hinge, and therefore, relative
to the wing, and voila - a perfect match!</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Match!</p><p>Yay! A perfect match.</p>
<p>Now, I know that in reality I will be drilling holes in spars in place based on
the pilots in the hinges (or the other way around, hinges based on holes in
spars (damn.. Im yet to decide.. :) ); but I'd rather start 'clean'.</p>

<div class="section" id="the-problem">
<h2>The Problem</h2>
<p>... was that I needed something to organize my builder's log. Being a software
engineer by trade, I didn't want to go old school with paper logs and pictures,
and whatever-random-collection-of-stuff-on-a-computer I could do. I wanted
something that's easy to add entries to, calculates everything automatically,
and allows me to publish it on the Web. Plus, I find it pleasant to view HTML
as opposed to .doc, .pdf, or whatever.</p>
<p>Being a nerd, I just had to make it as nice for myself as I could...</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-kitlog-pro">
<h2>The KitLog Pro</h2>
<p>Many-a-builder is using this apparently successful piece of work. Apparently,
as of writing this, they have over 1100 logs published on their
<a class="reference external" href="http://mykitlog.com">mykitlog.com</a>.</p>
<p>I have played around with it quite a bit. The program is trivially simple;
but I can't stand the way it's architected.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Windows only</li>
<li>Uses Access database for storage (sic!!)</li>
<li>Only three pictures per entry (really???)</li>
</ul>
<p>Oh, the Access databases. Basically, what this means to me as a user is if it
ever .. erm.. decides to stop working, I will loose all my data. &quot;Revert to a
backup&quot;, you say.. Yes, but if the problem is that I can't add my N+1st record
because the DB just corrupted itself, no backup will help -- I'm stuck.</p>
<p>On top of that if, god forbid, KitLog ever goes out of business, I am stuck
with the data that I can't export w/o some serious reverse engineering.</p>
<p>No thank you. :)</p>

<div class="section" id="the-early-attempts">
<h2>The Early Attempts</h2>
<p>So, I was toying around with other stuff.</p>
<div class="section" id="blogspot">
<h3>BlogSpot</h3>
<p>Really cool (probably, second best to WordPress) blogging platform. Plus,
links very nicely with Picasa, making image inserts a breeze.</p>
<p>The problem? How do I track time spent?</p>
<p>Also, the &quot;going-out-of-business&quot; problem was still there...</p>
<p>Moving on...</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="a-cms-drupal-or-joomla-or-whatever-custom-plugins">
<h3>A CMS (Drupal or Joomla or whatever) + custom plugins</h3>
<p>Now, that was better. Those are open source, good content entry and organization
tools, and I can export it all out of a MySQL DB should I need to.</p>
<p>But, they require a <em>server</em>  (which means either I'm
running a server, or require hosting). And frankly, I believed that there
must be a better way...</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="sphinx">
<h3>Sphinx</h3>
<p>Close, but no cigar. <a class="reference external" href="http://sphinx-doc.org">Sphinx</a> is the documentation
framework used by Python and many others (including the company I work for).</p>
<p>It takes a bunch of ReST files as input (more on that later), and runs them
through a converter, producing whatever you want (there are writers for html,
txt, doc, pdf, and so on). The parser and converter is called
<a class="reference external" href="http://docutils.sourceforge.net/">docutils</a>.</p>
<p>The problem with Sphinx is that it's geared towards writing documentation,
and frankly, felt a bit too heavy to me for writing a builder's log.</p>
<p>While googling about yet-another-thingie-I-wanted-to-figure-out-about-Sphinx,
I stumbled upon an article that talked about static site generators. There lied
the Holy Grail....</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="mutilation-of-the-pelican">
<h2>Mutilation of the Pelican</h2>
<p>The <a class="reference external" href="http://blog.getpelican.com/">Pelican</a>. I fell in love with this thing
almost immediately. Here's what it does:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Takes a directory with a bunch of <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReStructuredText">ReST</a>, <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown">Markdown</a>, or <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asciidoc">ASCIIDOC</a></li>
<li>Parses all those files into internal state, obtaining metadata from both files and paths (ie, if you organize your files in <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">category/&lt;date&gt;/name</span></tt> way, you can tell it to properly parse that path and populate the metadata)</li>
<li>Uses  <a class="reference external" href="http://jinja.pocoo.org/">Jinja</a> templates for generating a bunch of HTML output</li>
<li>Allows plugins and custom templates</li>
<li>Is all Python!</li>
</ul>
<p>I did the initial version in 2014 (the date of this article). Then, I've spent
about a week tearing it to pieces and figuring out how it works, and
adding a few plugins to add things that I needed for the B-Log that it didn't
have. I added time tracking, changed layout, got a Bootstrap-based template
and modified it, etc.</p>
<p>In 2018, I <a class="reference external" href="http://79ft.net/entries/2018-09-25-blog-2/">fixed some suff and added a few more things</a>.</p>
<p>You be the judge of results :).</p>
<p>Here's what I've done, in the end:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>I'm writing text in ReST, so I've added the custom directive to it allowing
for 'figures'. Problem is, ReST image directive produces HTML that wasn't
much useful to present images the way I wanted them. Instead of modifying
core Pelican code, I elected to add a custom 'Figure' directive. This is
done as a Pelican plugin. This plugin also  automatically adds thumbnails
for images. This is the <tt class="docutils literal">figure_process</tt> plugin. It also requires the
<tt class="docutils literal">image_copy</tt> plugin.</li>
<li>Another plugin I've written is <tt class="docutils literal">image_copy</tt>. It enables sane handling of
images placed next to the entries (pages and articles). Back when I started
in 2014, Pelican wanted you to separate images and text (and it's internal
mechanism of  <strong>not</strong> separating them was broken back then). Pelican guys
might've fixed this in the last 3 years, but hey, my setup worked for me -
and I kept it.</li>
<li>And most importantly, the plugin that allows the bulk of functionality - the
<tt class="docutils literal">b_log</tt> plugin. It does a lot of stuff:<ul>
<li>Generates the project structure (&quot;Project / Section&quot; concept with
multiple projects)</li>
<li>Enables a special metadata tag to track time in an article</li>
<li>Loads and parses logfiles that don't have articles associated with entries</li>
<li>Calculates totals</li>
<li>Creates internal data structures for theme templates to use</li>
<li>Renders log pages</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Then came theming. Pelican is geared towards bloggers, so I had to tweak a
lot of things to be better suited for B-Logging (build logging,
remember? :) ).  In the process, I've switched to
<a class="reference external" href="http://getbootstrap.com">Bootstrap</a>, since it makes it very easy to
organize content on a webpage. I added theme templates to produce the build
logs with totals, etc, etc. Also integrated
<a class="reference external" href="http://fancybox.net/">FancyBox</a> - a really cool JavaScript image overlay.</li>
<li>I added a couple of extras for myself - like silly QuOTD messages at the
bottom of each entry - but that's not <em>strictly</em> related to B-Logging...</li>
</ul>
<p>I like the end-result. I enjoyed hacking at it, and this was the first time
I touched Python (so had to learn that on the way). Pretty neat
(though I still prefer Perl (now, why do you need lists <em>and</em> tuples
<em>and</em>  sets again? :) ).</p>
<p>The only drawback is that it's regenerating everything every time.
You can easily see how that might become a problem when you get a lot of
entries, but I'm feeling like I'm ways away. 30 pages take about a second. I
think I will need a lot of records before this becomes a problem; and at that
point I will rewrite the whole damn thing to cache stuff.. probably :)</p>
<p>The code is  <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/fidot1983/b-log">here</a>. The repo
includes my theme, plugins, some tools, and sample content. It requires Python
(I used 3.6 and did <strong>not</strong> test anything else), Pelican (which
is checked into the repo in <tt class="docutils literal">pelican/</tt>, along with it's dependencies),
and Pillow (<tt class="docutils literal">pip install pillow</tt>). Oh yeah, and <tt class="docutils literal">pelicanconf.py</tt>'s
<tt class="docutils literal">PATH_METADATA</tt> will likely require tweaking of slashes on Windows.</p>
<p>Read the config file (<tt class="docutils literal">pelicanconf.py</tt>); and read thru
<a class="reference external" href="http://docs.getpelican.com/en/stable/quickstart.html">Pelican docs</a>
to get the idea. <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">sample-content/</span></tt> contains my sample generated content
that I was testing with. <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">content-gen/</span></tt> contains the simple Perl script that
generates as much sample content as you want.</p>
<div class="section" id="how-it-works">
<h3>How it Works</h3>
<p>To me as an end-user, it looks like this.</p>
<p>My source files are organized in directories like so:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
/project-one/section-one/

        2001-01-01-entry-one/
                    entry-one.rst
                    picture.jpg

        section-one-log.log

/project-one/section-two/

        2001-01-02-entry-two/
                    entry-two.rst
                    picture.jpg

        section-two-log.log

/project-two/section-one/

        2002-01-01-entry-one/
                    entry-one.rst
                    picture.jpg

/project-two/section-two/

        2002-01-02-entry-two/
                    entry-two.rst
                    picture.jpg
</pre>
<p>and so on. Note the text <tt class="docutils literal">*.log</tt> files - those are just log entries
without the articles. They are optional, as you can see
in <tt class="docutils literal">Project Two</tt>.</p>
<p>Text log files look like this:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
2011-01-01 | Some Summary Here       | 1.02
2011-01-02 | Some Other Summary Here | 2.02
</pre>
<p>Note the separator - that's configurable :).</p>
<p>There can be as many log files in a &quot;Project/Section&quot; as one wishes, they
will all be parsed, and all entries will be  properly sorted by date.</p>
<p>There can be entire sections without articles - but a project <strong>must
have at least one article</strong> to be properly displayed. Yeah, you got
to at least declare your intentions :).</p>
<p>This directory structure will get parsed into two Projects
(<tt class="docutils literal">Project One</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">Project Two</tt>) with their separate logs.
Each project will get it's own menu on the left. To display the menus,
<tt class="docutils literal">B_LOG_PROJECTS_MENU</tt> config var should list them.</p>
<p>If there was any time logged in a project (either in article entries,
log files, or both), that project's menu will get an extra &quot;Log&quot; entry, which
will neatly display all log entries, and some totals.</p>
<p>There are a few special directories I use, <tt class="docutils literal">pages</tt> (configurable
in <tt class="docutils literal">PAGE_PATHS</tt>) for static pages
(ie, <a class="reference external" href="http://79ft.net/pages/about/">About</a> section
of this site is a static page), and <tt class="docutils literal">blog</tt>, for blog entries (they don't
show up under any projects).</p>
<p>If I want a new article-type entry, I just add a directory in the
<tt class="docutils literal">project/section</tt> path, and start writing
the article in my favorite text editor (<a class="reference external" href="http://www.vim.org">VIM!!</a>).
If I decide to log time, I just use my special <tt class="docutils literal">logged</tt> metadata entry
at the top of the article.  I drop images into article's directory, and use
my <tt class="docutils literal">figure</tt> ReST directive to reference them.</p>
<p>If I just need to log some time without polluting the Internet too much
with useless text, I add it to an appropriate <tt class="docutils literal">.log</tt> file, or
create a new one.</p>
<p>If I don't want to log time, I don't have to - I can just post an
entry into the project w/o time logged.</p>
<p>After I'm done, I run Pelican, which generates
the full website (html, images, everything!) into an output directory. Voila!
I can stop right there, and I will have a fully working local version of my
log, since it's all static HTML,
but we want this online, don't we? So, the only thing left is...</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="hosting">
<h3>Hosting</h3>
<p>This was another revelation. Apparently, <a class="reference external" href="http://github.org">GitHub</a> hosts
static pages! 'Uploading a site' is a <tt class="docutils literal">git push</tt>, and it transfers only
deltas, so no fiddling with FTP, rsync, or whatever! They allow custom domain
names instead of <tt class="docutils literal">username.github.io</tt>, all you need is to set your A records
in your DNS to point to their servers. It's awesome!</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="and-so">
<h2>And So,</h2>
<p>I am very happy with this so far. I have all my logs in  practically plain text
format, parser for which is open source and available. I have it nicely
organized, and I can back it up as I please (to GitHub, anyone? :) ). I can
re-write the programs that parse and produce final .html. I can extend the
generator and change the theme to produce a printable version of the log, styled
for paper rather than web. The list goes on!</p>
