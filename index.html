<hr class="dashed"/><p>Only had a few hours today, so decided to concentrate on taking off the wing root fairings. As I mentioned before, the &quot;back-side accessible&quot;
screws were set up to have nuts on them rather than nutplates. Well, I don't know about that accessibility....</p>
<p>It ended up being 3 hours for ~30 screws.</p>

   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/chickenhouse-charger2019-annual-2019-04-06-annual/4-6-1-thumb.jpg" title="Root fairing off" alt="Root fairing off" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Root fairing off</p><p>Most of them on the back side of the wing require you reaching with a wrench thru the rear cockpit, and my arm is just barely long enough
to do that successfully. Since nuts are nyloc, no way I can hold them with my fingers - they need a socket.</p>
<p>Some of those nuts are in a U-type channel over which the fabric is glued, and some of the holes are off-center: making it impossible to put a socket over them.</p>
<p>I could've ground a socket down; but I don't have a grinder - so especially one of the nuts took a while to get off. And oh, you have to do
all that without dropping the nut and the washer onto the floor (and having them go into the tail). So the process looked like this:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Get your hand in, try to put the socket over the nut.</li>
<li>While holding the ratchet,  try to put the screwdriver into the screw w/o missing it and poking a hole in the fabric.</li>
<li>Undo the screw, almost.</li>
<li>Remove the socket, take a strong magnet.</li>
<li>Finish undoing the screw, hoping that the magnet will catch the washer and the nut.</li>
</ul>
<p>Having magnetic sockets helped. They weren't deep enough to grab most of the fully tightened nuts because screws protruded from them. I used them as magnets sometimes, and sometimes used my magnetic &quot;fishing for lost hardware&quot; probe.</p>
<p>Now I'm writing this, I realized what I should've been doing is using a long extension and a 90 degree adapter on my socket. Damn! But this still doesn't solve
the problem with some of the nuts that were hidden almost behind things that were in the way (ie, a trim control wheel's attachment structure that's
welded into the fuselage).</p>

and then Tinnermans on top of it. Since Tinnermans are long, when undoing (or tightening) the screw, they will turn and touch the side of the U-channel, which will act as a wrench.</p>

<h2>Decision</h2>
<p>After <a class="reference external" href="http://79ft.net/entries/chickenhouse-chargerblog-2019-03-27-meet-81G/">getting the Charger</a>, I have decided to fix
a few basics.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Clean plugs</li>
<li>Change oil</li>
<li>Give her a good look over</li>
</ul>
<p>Getting a bit ahead of myself, a series of coincidences (airport closed, baffles' condition, intake leak, and others)
made me decide to go thru the annu... sorry, Condition inspection (damn, will have to get used to new nomenclature :) ).</p>

<h2>Notes</h2>
<p>Cowling came off.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/chickenhouse-charger2019-annual-2019-03-30-annual/3-30-1.jpg" title="Cowling off" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/chickenhouse-charger2019-annual-2019-03-30-annual/3-30-1-thumb.jpg" title="Cowling off" alt="Cowling off" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Cowling off</p><p>Discovered a few booboos:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Cracked cowl inlet ramp: need to stop drill.</li>
<li>Baffle seal behind the inlet ramp is turned the wrong way (Glenn was complaining about high temps - one of the reasons, hmm?).</li>
<li>Top baffle seals are too hard and sag in few spots.</li>
<li>One of the air take-offs off the ramp has almost un-riveted itself.</li>
</ul>
<p>Since I will need some helps with skills and tools with riveting, and we'll need to pull the prop to change (and turn the right way) the
seals, decided that I will put her thru annual.</p>
<p>Studying the systems (I was mainly concentrated on fuel and other al lines and hoses to see where things go), discovered a few things, too</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>She has the Rotec TBI-40-MKI TBI installed, which requires a 40 mesh filter <em>upstream</em> of it. The only filter besides finger strainers in tanks is gascolator, which goes down to 72 micron (0.003) only. Need to get a hold of Rotec people and discuss this situation.</li>
<li>The &quot;low&quot; end of the tank (in 3-point attitude) has a very nice drain fitting + drain cock draining behind the cowl. I am seriously considering adding a quick drain there - that <em>is</em> the lowest point of the tank in 3-point. My thinking is: water collected in the tank, goes to that lowest point; but there's not enough of it to go thru the take-off (which is in the middle). Then, when I raise the tail, it slushes forward, goes into the take-off, and reaches the engine right when I am just off the runway. Not Good.</li>
<li>Some un-critical drain hoses are clear vinyl and hard as a rock. For now will replace them with clear polyurethane, and if that hardens, with rubber.</li>
<li>TBI needs positive stops on the throttle quadrant. Need to check if they're present and adjust as necessary.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Fairings</h2>
<p>Spent the rest of the day taking off fairings and access panels. This is the first thing I thing could've been done better here methinks. Everywhere where
it was deemed that the back side would be &quot;accessible&quot;, Remo used #6-32 nyloc AN nuts on machine screws instead of nutplates. Well, some of those nuts
are <em>not</em> accessible, and I gave up on quite a bit of them around the rear wing root fairings.</p>
<p>Need to standardize on fasteners' length so that I don't juggle 10 different screw sizes.</p>

<h2>Fade In</h2>
<p>I met Glenn and Judi in 2014.</p>
<p>This was my second Oshkosh, and the first time I noticed the Biplane Forum's
Beer'O'Clock thread.</p>
<p>We had two &quot;events&quot; that year: one in the Vintage at the
awesome Piper Pub (yep, the spelling is right - it was a Tri-Pacer with the
baggage door that had a beer tap. The guy who owned it claimed he had an STC;
but paperwork got soaked in beer and was drying somewhere). We sneaked in a large
cooler of Austin sour beer then, hauling it all the way from the opposite end of Camp
Scholler. I met Glenn there, and later that night washed out in his camp and was fed
with a kick-ass grilled cheese sandwich, and met Judi.</p>
<p>The second &quot;event&quot; was at Glenn's airplane, parked near Homebuilder's HQ. It was a beautiful
Marquart Charger, I learned then; a 1987 Golden Lindy recipient, built by Remo Galeazzi in Petaluma, CA.</p>
<p>That biplane was beautiful; just the right curves and not as aggressive as more modern ones like Pitts and Skybolts.
It looked straight from the 1930s, with wooden prop tipping the nose. I fell in love with it.</p>
<p>In 2015, we've had a good crowd around the plane.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/chickenhouse-chargerblog-2019-03-27-meet-81G/osh15.jpg" title="Oshkosh 2015 Biplane Forum Beer'o'Clock crowd" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/chickenhouse-chargerblog-2019-03-27-meet-81G/osh15-thumb.jpg" title="Oshkosh 2015 Biplane Forum Beer'o'Clock crowd" alt="Oshkosh 2015 Biplane Forum Beer'o'Clock crowd" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Oshkosh 2015 Biplane Forum Beer'o'Clock crowd</p><p>Glenn's Charger became a traditional spot for these beer get-togethers, and we became friends who only met at Oshkosh; but to me
it felt like I knew Glenn for my whole life, and 11.5 months between AirVentures felt like hours.</p>
<p>In 2016, I was finally around Chicago where Glenn lived, and he took me out to his home field, Poplar Grove.
Man, what an airport! Just the right kind for his plane. We spent a day there, and I think I have seen only <em>one</em> spam can
and maybe one RV. The others were a few Cubs, a Twin Beech, a Waco, and the like. A few friends showed up, and that day I got
a ride in an AcroSport bipe, and later in the evening, finally, in the Charger.</p>
<p>Oh man. I flew a couple sport biplanes before; and while I liked them, they were too much for this lazy guy. Just a bit too twitchy and
too sensitive.</p>
<p>This plane? It flew just like a Grumman. Perfect control harmony. Perfect, light forces on both elevator and ailerons. It fit like a glove.</p>
<p>Then, that night, by the way, I started seriously reconsidering building a Skybolt (BTW, this site was started as a Builder's Log for a Skybolt).
I flew one, and while I still liked the plane, I liked the Charger even more.</p>
<p>Especially with it's more &quot;classic&quot; looks (and come on, admit it, we pick biplanes for looks), and it's perfect flyability.</p>
<p>In 2017, we did Beer'o'Clock at my camp (I forget why.. maybe the Charger wasn't around).</p>
<p>And later that year, Glenn told me he's thinking about selling it. He got too much stuff on his hands, and didn't want to neglect the Grand Champion.</p>
<p>I thought for about a day. I loved <a class="reference external" href="http://79ft.net/tag/9891u.html">my Cheetah</a>, and I loved the fact that it was a &quot;normal&quot; airplane. I could take my 2 year old son up
in it. Not in a biplane. I could take &quot;normal&quot; people up in a Cheetah. Not in an open cockpit biplane - at least, it's a bit more.. rough, shall we say?</p>
<p>But I couldn't let the plane I loved just be sold on the Barnstormers; so the next day I told Glenn I'll take care of her when the time comes. I was overwhelmed,
and honored to have a chance of taking care of a piece of aviating and homebuilding history.</p>

<h2>The Plane</h2>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/chickenhouse-chargerblog-2019-03-27-meet-81G/beauty.jpg" title="The MA5 Charger" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/chickenhouse-chargerblog-2019-03-27-meet-81G/beauty-thumb.jpg" title="The MA5 Charger" alt="The MA5 Charger" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">The MA5 Charger</p><p>She was built in 1982. From what I could gather, she was started in 1977. There were two guys who built two MA5 Chargers in a chickenhouse in Petaluma, CA.
Glenn's plane was built by Remo Galeazzi, and won the Golden Lindy in 1987. The other Charger won too by the way, some years earlier :).</p>
<p>Remo wrote a <a class="reference external" href="/pdfs/chicken-house-chargers.pdf">really nice article for Sport Aviation about both planes</a>.</p>
<p>Here's <a class="reference external" href="/pdfs/remos-charger.pdf">another article about the plane</a>.</p>
<p>Glenn changed it a bit, adding the smoke system, changing the prop to wood, and tweaking the induction and fuel systems. But the plane stayed all original
mostly - original engine, original fabric, and such.</p>
<p>Oh, and it's <em>the</em> Charger <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marquart_MA-5_Charger">on Wikipedia</a> :)!</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="logistics">
<h2>Logistics</h2>
<p>I told Glenn to give me 6 months heads up, so that I could work out the logistics.</p>
<p>See, I have lots of hours to be very comfy flying any common tricycle single. I didn't have enough experience to haul a <em>taildragger bipe</em> across the country
(Glenn moved to CA by then). I would have to learn how to fly it comfortably before embarking on the trip; and figure out the logistics.</p>
<p>But then, things went much faster than I thought.</p>
<p>At Oshkosh 2018, Glenn was telling me he's about to sell the plane. I realized I didn't have time to train enough, and that it would be better to train
in the Charger from the getgo. So the working plan became me renting a large-ish truck, and hauling the airplane over to Texas with wings off.</p>
<p>And then, Glenn offered to fly the plane over himself, as a good bye to her. I couldn't refuse.</p>
<p>September 2018, Glenn told me he's gonna fly the plane over soon. I put the Cheetah up for sale, and
<a class="reference external" href="http://79ft.net/entries/misccheetah-2018-11-21-bye/">said my last goodbyes to her</a> November 21, 2018. Then, life and weather intervened, and we couldn't set the
trip up till last weekend.</p>
<p>'It's warming up', Glenn texted me a week and a half ago.</p>
<p>A week after that text, he was wheels up en route to TX, with Judi in the front hole.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-trip">
<h2>The Trip</h2>
<p>That didn't last long. An hour and change later, Glenn was stuck in Bakersfield, just at the southern tip of Central Valley, CA. All mountain passes
were blocked by low ceilings...</p>
<p>What's funny was that I was flying.. strike that, being flown from San Jose to Los Angeles, continuing to Texas, the same day Glenn and Judi were stuck at Bakersfield. I saw the damn
clouds blocking the passes. They were maybe a mile wide!!!</p>
<p>This delayed them by about 24 hours, but the rest of the trip was fairly smooth. They did a lot of flying after being stuck in Bakersfield for practically a whole day, and
some hours the following day.</p>

<p>It was all so fast, I was in the state of... denial? and disbelief? I started becoming overwhelmed when I got back home in the evening on that day, and opened up the
logbooks.</p>
<p>Remo's signatures and flight log.</p>
<p>Remo's letters.</p>
<p>Glenn's signatures and notes.</p>
<p>The letter from Remo to Glenn, with a bunch of pictures - just pictures of this Charger being built; mundane almost; but a part of the Champion's history.</p>

<hr class="dashed"/><p>Great weather today. A bit cold, but sunny, calm, and overall very promising.</p>
<p>I rolled out the Cheetah out of her hangar for the last time.</p>
<p>This was a weird feeling.</p>
<p>When you have an airplane sitting in the hangar 20 minutes away from your
house, you tend to sometimes put flying off.</p>
<p>It typically goes along these lines.</p>
<p>Hey, it's Saturday coming up. I gotta go bounce around! <em>check the weather</em>
Hmm...looks a bit iffy. Maybe I should do
<em>this-other-thing-around-the-house-shop-or-whatever-I-hadn't-gotten-around-to</em>.
Maybe, I'll go flying after that...</p>
<p>Evening rolls in, you're tired and not up for flying anymore.. Meanwhile,
weather was perfect the whole day!</p>
<p>&quot;Next week&quot;,
you think. And you go out next week, but this time it's something else that
pops up and you have to get to it later in the day, and instead of spending
half a day bouncing around, you buzz around the pattern for half an hour and
go back to your daily messes and stuff to do around the house.</p>
<p>Not every Saturday was like that since I got back to having time to do plane
stuff... but often, it did.</p>
<p>But this time, today. It was weird. The knowing that I am flying <em>her</em> for
the last time, that I am listening to GTU ATIS on <em>her</em> radios for the last
time, the last VOR to be tuned in, last turn direct to the destination, last
approach guy handing you over to your destination's Tower...</p>
<p>&quot;Field in sight&quot;...</p>
<p>On a day like today...</p>
<p>Sunny, silky smooth, a touch of clouds, with all the gauges' needles frozen
in place...</p>
<p>You remember all the good times you had together, and think... I'll miss you,
Cheetah!</p>
<p>I guess, in the Spirit of Thanksgiving..?</p>
<p>Thank you for all the wingovers, low passes over lakes, and river runs.</p>
<p>Thank you for all the kids we've flown as Young Eagles.</p>
<p>Thank you for getting my ass out of that fog along the coast of Madagorda Island (that one was the &quot;bag of luck&quot; to &quot;bag of experience&quot; type thing for sure!)</p>
<p>Thank you for all the <a class="reference external" href="/tag/9891u.html">fun I had messing with you</a>.</p>
<p>Thank you for that unique kind of smell that your inside smelled with (and my tiger LeRoy who lived in the plane still smells like you!)</p>
<p>Thank you for being a good plane and not giving me any trouble.</p>
<p>I hope I'll see you again sometime! And maybe then, we'll go bounce around
together again. Just like the good old times.</p>

<hr class="dashed"/><p><a class="reference external" href="http://79ft.net/entries/blog-pickles/">As we have established before</a>, Fall for Russians is all about pickling things.</p>
<p>Last time it was an O-360. This time, it's tools for the new shop.</p>
<p>My current shop is all packed up and in storage, waiting for the actual
shop to be built. Well, actually for the building to be gutted.</p>
<p>When I have built the new house, I have kept the old house. That's what's
about to become my Dream Shop. Meanwhile, all my tools are nicely set up
in my storage shed, waiting for their time.</p>
<p>I have sold most of my Chinese Grizzly crap I bought before knowing
any better, and was hunting good, old, American-made machines for a while.</p>
<p>Okay, I settled for a Chinese-made Powermatic drill press, arguing with
myself that it was in mint shape, dialed in with no obvious runout / shake,
and would be my wood-only press anyway.</p>
<p>But two most important things wood-wise I still didn't have: a jointer and a
table saw. Few had come up on Craigslist, and I would go over to check them out
with all my dial gauges and a U-Haul trailer in tow.</p>
<p>I would spend close to an hour with each one of them, measuring all sorts of
convoluted alignments and run-outs, only to find something very <em>basic</em> wrong
with them.</p>
<p>One of these was a newer (mustard, but still American-made) PM60 jointer. It
checked out reasonably well; until I asked the guy if I could adjust his fence
square (I wanted to check it's warp by measuring squareness to tables along
it's length).</p>
<p>&quot;Sure Thing!&quot; - he said, walked to a corner of his shop, picked up a hammer,
and ... WHACK! - ... ... yeah. Call me a WHACK-o, but that is <em>not</em> how you
adjust squareness...  Not in my book. I felt for the poor machine.</p>
<p>I left, of course.</p>
<p>Another time I spent just south of 40 minutes with a PM66 table saw, only to check
it's flatness dead last. Of course, it was so horribly bowed out of shape,
I had to leave. And <em>that</em> was a 3 hour drive. Each way, mind you!</p>
<p>At any rate, yet another PM60 jointer popped up on Craigslist, and I grabbed
a trailer in preparation of going to San Antonio the next day. That's where
the jointer was.</p>
<p>Now, there was a rolling joke with one of the guys from the office - that he
absolutely HAS to convince yet another guy from our office, his buddy, to
sell me his PM66 saw - or, Russian Mafia will get him! Them both, in fact!</p>
<p>I kept it up for over a year; and I am not sure if that joke had made any
contribution to this... but, he called me and said, &quot;Roger is selling his
Powermatic! Grab it, QUICK!&quot;. Same day as the jointer popped up.</p>
<p>Hah. So tomorrow I am about to go possibly pick up a jointer.
Did I just land me a saw too?</p>
<p>I went to Roger's to dial the saw.</p>
<p>Arbor was shot, but trunnions were in great shape, and arbor for PM-66 is not
a problem (someone still literally makes them and sells them on EBay). The
tables were flat aside from a very tiny dip, a bit dirty at that, but alright.</p>
<p>I decided to pick it up.</p>
<p>So I did land me a saw and a possible jointer!!!</p>
<p>Next day (Friday), I rush to San Antonio to look at the jointer.</p>
<p>It was a green, older one, and it checked out good, except one minor
mis-alignment of infeed and outfeed tables. I was trying to tighten them up
a touch with gib set screws, and... I broke one of them.</p>
<p>The tables were flat, the motor was good, and the price was reasonable though,
so I decided to buy it from the guy - especially after I broke it :).</p>
<p>Didn't take any pictures of jointer in transit... damn.</p>
<p>So, Friday night Im back, barely manage to roll the jointer off the trailer and into the garage, and Saturday I pack my wrenches and such to go break down the saw at Roger's.</p>
<p>See, it was set up with a large side table, router plate insert, and outfeeds
- no way I would've been able to load all that; and besides,  I don't need
any of that aside from core saw. I already have all my router stuff from
my previous shop (<a class="reference external" href="http://www.incrementaltools.com/">Incra</a> no less).</p>
<p>It's raining. Damn.</p>
<p>I get to his place - he's gone for the weekend, his wife lets me in and leaves
me alone with the saw and my tools.</p>

<hr class="dashed"/><p>After using <a class="reference external" href="http://79ft.net/entries/miscb-log-2014-05-20-b-log/">the setup I did for myself in 2014</a> for a while,  I decided it was time to change things around a bit.</p>
<div class="section" id="segway">
<h2>Segway</h2>
<p><em>... so yeah. I needed to add a static page, and I had a bunch of ideas about
extra stuff I wanted to do for a while. But mostly, I just needed to add a
damn static page, and thinking about coercing the existing setup into
doing that with all the pictures I needed there was not making me happy...</em></p>
<p><em>... it was also about time I set this thing up so that I could actually
log more projects than just a single airplane. Hey, I bet we all
know - websites of this kind are mostly created to be later enjoyed by their
authors in periods of 'I ain't got nothing better to do than review
my old notes' mood ...</em></p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="multiple-projects">
<h2>Multiple Projects</h2>
<p>First of all, I wanted to be able to log multiple projects. The way the old
setup was done was it had basically one project, under the section
called &quot;Build&quot;, and then this dangling catch-all &quot;blog&quot; thing for everything
else.</p>
<p>But as you can see, most of articles here actually are NOT about the airplane
I was working on at the time - the Skybolt - but rather, other little things
here and there.</p>
<p>First thing I did, is I changed the way the files are laid out, and added
semantics converting source content's directory structure to
&quot;Project / Section&quot; semantics.</p>
<p>Each project now has it's own &quot;sub-log&quot; (that's what time logged is tracked
based on). There is still a catch-all &quot;blog&quot; section, and a &quot;default&quot;
project that can be configured if one so desires.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="logging">
<h2>Logging</h2>
<p>One more thing I realised is that the original version would only allow to log
time if it was associated with an article-type entry... Flooding the Internet
with tens of pages of &quot;built three more ribs tonight&quot; type stuff <em>just to log
time</em> seemed kinda silly, so I added support for plain text log entries.</p>
<p>Articles still can track time; but you can also now have a separate text
file with just &quot;Date&quot;, &quot;Summary&quot;, and &quot;Time Logged&quot; entries - one per line.</p>
<p>When creating the &quot;log&quot; page for a project, entries, being both
from articles and from logfiles, are sorted by date,
and then ones with articles associated with them will pick their summaries up
from articles. Entries coming from text files will be displayed with summaries
from log files.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="major-code-cleanup">
<h2>Major Code Cleanup</h2>
<p>All this time tracking functionality, structuring articles into projects, and
such, were becoming  an entity of its own large enough for me to justify
clumping it all into a single Pelican's plugin, now called &quot;b_log&quot;. I also
added a bunch of config options to set up it's behavior.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="no-google-analytics">
<h2>No Google Analytics</h2>
<p>Yeah. I killed it. This site Does Not Track You now. Because there's too
much of this crap online.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="fixes-fixes-fixes">
<h2>Fixes, Fixes, Fixes</h2>
<p>Too many to count...</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Fixed how logos and icons behave</li>
<li>Fixed templates in numerous places</li>
<li>Fixed bugs in image processing and copying</li>
<li>Images in <em>pages</em> now handled properly - they just weren't. At all</li>
<li>Decimals in logged times would sometimes show up to 10 digits past the decimal
point</li>
<li>...</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="silliness">
<h2>Silliness</h2>
<p>And finally, some silliness! I wrote another plugin that adds a &quot;quote of the
day&quot; at the end of each article, randomly :) Enjoy; and I hope they will
encourage you to read more articles (or at least, scroll thru them
to get to the bits of wisdom).</p>

<hr class="dashed"/><p>In the past 7 months I have been busy building... the crib for the baby. Almost
non stop evenings, 4-6 hours a day: the result is good, but this is a &quot;Skybolt
Story&quot;, not a &quot;Bed Story&quot;: so no, I won't post all my projects here :).</p>
<p>Also, it seems like next 2-3 years will be mostly furniture building for
this guy.. Oh well.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I was able to put in a few hours into fixing up the coves in
my wingtips where all the lights are.</p>
<p>If you recall, I have made <a class="reference external" href="http://79ft.net/entries/misccheetah-cheetah-strobe-shields/">strobe shields</a> quite a while back, but I haven't fixed up the coves. I was waiting for the shields to be painted.</p>
<p>Well, they were during the <a class="reference external" href="http://79ft.net/entries/misccheetah-cgr-30/">cgr-30 install</a>,
and then I was working on the crib.. So finally, the time has come.</p>
<p>Look at what I had to start with.</p>

   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/misccheetah-cheetah-wingtips-cleanup/wingtips-1-thumb.jpg" title="Sad sad wingtip" alt="Sad sad wingtip" >

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Another sad wingtip</p><p>First, all the lights came out. The old plastic lenses went straight into the
trash bin. Then, came off the foam padding that goes in between the lens and the
wingtip.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/misccheetah-cheetah-wingtips-cleanup/wingtips-3.jpg" title="All opened up" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/misccheetah-cheetah-wingtips-cleanup/wingtips-3-thumb.jpg" title="All opened up" alt="All opened up" >

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Cleaned and sanded</p><p>I think the above was about an hour of sanding. All old paint came off. Also,
the broken rivnut went out (did you notice it? That extra hole was what someone
has drilled and used a sheet metal screw to &quot;fix&quot; it instead of drilling out
the broken rivnut).</p>
<p>Finally, masked with the first set of masking tape. I was set to repaint the
coves.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Masking the edges</p><p>The other wingtip was even worse. The cove itself had a huge &quot;dip&quot; in it.
Also, some &quot;genius&quot; decided to screw #10 screws straight into the fiberglass...
Some threads were all torn up, and I decided to install rivnuts all around
to make sure the tips match.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Fitting holes in the strobe shield</p><p>And we're ready with the second one.</p>
<p>Now, I wanted to clean up the nav lights housing as well. Originally I wanted to paint both cover and base, but once I cleaned up the base, I decided to leave it as is: apparently, it was nice and shiny after all that 40 year old corrosion
cleaned off of it!</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Came out nice after painting!</p><p>Then, final masking, and painting. Damn! That didn't go so well. I didn't
notice a fairly small dip in the other tip's cove, and the Bondo'd one got some
pinholes. Time was running very short so I ended up leaving that as is.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Left tip. That one with pinholes :(</p><p>Once the paint was all dry came the time for fitting the foam padding and
lenses. And here, I made a fatal mistake: I have installed the padding <em>first</em>. That makes fitting of the lens virtually impossible (at least, for me).</p>
<p>That had produced an unsightly gap of about 1/8 inches. Oh god! I had no spare lenses, and I <em>had</em> to put the plane back together not to screw my partner who needed the plane soon. Very soon.</p>
<p>... I ended up screwing him anyway 'cause somewhere in the middle of me fitting
that first lens Max was born and I was knocked out for 5 days ...</p>
<p>... just in case you're wondering: 7lbs 11oz, 20 inches, June 25, 2015, 10:35 am ...</p>
<p>... I still haven't had any chance to get another lens, so I decided to put it back together as is as a memory of me being stupid. Maybe I'll buy another set from Ken in another year or two; and also fix all the dips and pinholes ...</p>

<hr class="dashed"/><p>I'm done with my longest airplane project so far! No, it's not for the Skybolt, it's for my Cheetah. But it's an important one and was a great fun to tackle.</p>
<p>So, without further adieu...</p>
<p>The Cheetah never had an engine analyzer -- and I elected to get one, full blown, replacing all the standard engine gauges. I ended up picking the <a class="reference external" href="http://buy-ei.com/portfolio/cgr-30p-overview/">EI's CGR-30P</a> because of it's roundness, compactness, and me generally liking EI a lot.</p>
<p>So, late August, it was Christmas. I got the box, that had a lot of boxes, with boxes, and boxes inside -- lots of stuff. Probes, aggregator box, wires...</p>
<p>First thing I did was put everything together on my dining table, just to make sure I understand the wire-up and that it works. I have even blown into the fuel transducer and was satisfied seeing it registering some &quot;flow&quot;.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/misccheetah-cgr-30/00-cgr30.jpg" title="On the bench" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/misccheetah-cgr-30/00-cgr30-thumb.jpg" title="On the bench" alt="On the bench" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">On the bench</p><p>And then, the install. The problem was, I also wanted to fly in between, so I had to plan the install in stages and make sure the airplane's flyable in between.</p>
<div class="section" id="session-1">
<h2>Session 1</h2>
<p>First thing was running two out of three wire harnesses thru the firewall (all temp probes, and all pressure and flow transducers). I found a spot on the inside of the firewall for the box, and made sure I had enough length to run to the &quot;aggregator&quot; box.</p>

<h2>Session 2</h2>
<p>I was planning to fly out to friend's hangar and work on the probes install there. The luck did not cooperate -- very sluggish pull-thru on the engine start and heavy discharge right after on the ammeter hinted at the alternator failure.</p>
<p>Sure enough, it was. I ended up unbuttoning the cowl at the FBO I was hangaring at.</p>

<p>This time it was a day to install the &quot;aggregator box&quot;. All the probes feed into it, and there's a single wire that connects the box to the display of the engine monitor.</p>
<p>I didn't know what the exact length of the screws to mount it would be, so I decided to buy a bunch of different ones. Didn't have any way to measure the firewall thickness.</p>

<h2>Session 6</h2>
<p>Finally, back to the hangar! This session took 2 days actually :). It was the time to install, wire up, re-position all the gauges on the panel, and such.</p>
<p>The old CHT, EGT and hobbs were to go. Clock was to be relocated to the position it's visible at (it was right under the panel eyebrow before). Davtron OAT/PALT/DALT/Volts gauge was to be relocated to another spot in the panel to free up space for CGR-30 auxiliary panel I made in the previous session. And, most of wireup had to be done. Harnesses connected to the box, ran to the display, and power.</p>

Oh, and the old tach (I had one of those fancy Horizon P1000's that tells you if a mag is dead) is showing everything's okay. And, the engine starts doing this rattle sound, and quits. WTF?!</p>
<p>Thoughts about grounding something I shouldn't have grounded (ie, a plead) cross my mind. Then, thoughts about a loose screw somewhere next to the ignition switch crosses my mind.</p>
<p>I re-try. Same thing. Engine starts, runs a few seconds, and dies off. WHAAA??!</p>
<p>... I decide to go take a bathroom break. On the way back, another thought crosses my mind.... I get back, practically running, get into the plane - and sure enough! Fuel selector is &quot;off&quot;. I switched it off the day before, before getting behind the panel. Just in case :) Phew.</p>
<p>The &quot;right mag&quot; problem doesn't go away though. I start diagnosing -- touching input wires to different pegs on the ignition key -- no matter which mag it is, &quot;left&quot; is okay and &quot;right&quot; is dead. Uneasy thoughts about a dead wire in the harness and having to undo the whole thing start crowding me... But, I decide to dig a bit deeper. Success!</p>
<p>Can you spot the problem?</p>

<h2>Session 7</h2>
<p>It was that time to go to Fletcher's and continue working on it there. Plus, my new wheelpants were ready!</p>
<p>Before I went though, I had to make one last missing bit. A bracket for the ammeter shunt. Did that at the home shop; and did it in a couple different widths to see which one fits better. That bracket was supposed to plug the hole left after old engine gauges removal, and hold the shunt.</p>
<p>By the way, I decided to wire the shunt into the battery leads. First of all, that's how Grummans are wired by default; and second, it actually shows you the actual discharge when you're on battery -- a good thing! It doesn't show the true load when charging the battery though -- just the charge current. That's okay though, as long as charge current remains <em>positive</em> I know my alt is okay.</p>

<p>Onward - to Fletcher's!</p>
<p>We've measured lengths for all the new hoses; and decided to change all of them -- mine were manufactured 15 years ago. Also, found a small oil cooler leak, and decided to replace that bad boy. Oh, and I was finishing up behind the panel while David's guys were working on fitting and trimming my wheelpants.</p>
<p>I took out all the gauges, unwired everything that was to be removed, and installed the shunt... Then, it was time to call that a day since Clayton was supposed to fly me back, and I didn't want to make him go back after dark.</p>

<h2>And so</h2>
<p>I suppose I have to give some final thoughts.</p>
<p>Here's what I like about the gauge:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Compact, takes only one hole.</li>
<li>Not square! I hate square display engine analyzers. Don't fit right into the steam panels.</li>
<li>Good documentation. Sometimes missing details like torques, but otherwise good.</li>
<li>Great packaging and wiring harness pre-setup! Each wire came with a little sleeve identifying it. Didn't ever need to look at the harnesses diagram for wire-up.</li>
<li>Great software and setup.</li>
<li>Great support.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here's what I didn't like:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Single-stranded, unprotected wires for the probes</li>
<li>The fact that I had to run the harness into the box, and then connect the box to the display. In my case, it made the wires longer, since they had to run from the in-hole in the middle of the firewall to the side where the box was mounted. Would've been easier to go straight to the display. I discussed this with EI actually; and they said that that was a long debated issue -- and they opted for the box, since that setup helps guys that have their engines far from panels (twins for example). I understand this rationale.</li>
<li>#8 mounting holes on the &quot;aggregator box&quot; with countersunk screws. Would've been much easier if they had a #10 holes for AN3 bolts.</li>
<li>Quality of OLP-1 barrel connectors. Very sharp plastic edges. I wasn't comfortable tying them to the wires just like that and had to hand-deburr all of them.</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, I love it. Great gauge, and I will be putting that on the Skybolt! :)</p>

<hr class="dashed"/><p>No posts about the Skybolt doesn't mean that there was nothing done :). Yessir!</p>
<p>I was redrawing pretty much everything I did in the first few months of modeling the lower wing; and that ate up a bunch of time and didn't actually produce anything to show. But damn, did it suck up time!</p>
<p>I ended up re-doing:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Spars</li>
<li>All ribs</li>
<li>Full wing assembly (now it's clean and easy to tweak)</li>
<li>A lot of compression plates</li>
<li>Complete aileron assembly</li>
</ul>
<p>Especially with ribs, the problem was that I did them while learning SolidWorks -- which led me to sketching them in AutoCad first (I used to hate doing curves in SWX.. now I hate Autocad, but that's another story :)). That made them virtually un-tweakable; and &quot;tweaking&quot; the verticals, which I <a class="reference external" href="http://79ft.net/entries/skyboltwings-2014-09-01/">had to do after confirming drag wire interference</a>, proved to be virtually impossible.</p>
<p>So, I decided to clean it all up. Oh yeah, and I have moved that interfering vertical.</p>
<p>The brand-spanking new set of ribs:</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Rrriiibbzzz!! Oh, wait...</p><p>And then, only then, I could go on to finishing the tip rib and the aileron tip rib.</p>
<p>For tip rib, I used the positioned tip bow to project the cuts onto the surface of the nose block. I'll explain this technique in a bit with aileron as illustration.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Tip, and other ribs, on the spars, and tip bow</p><p>And then there's the aileron, it's bow, and tip rib.</p>
<p>I started with a &quot;placeholder&quot; that was the inboard (full size) butt rib. Then, using the tip bow, I drew a couple of &quot;guide curves&quot; and projected it on a couple planes, corresponding to ribs, giving me two different profiles.</p>

<p>After that, I drew the butt rib. <a class="reference external" href="http://79ft.net/entries/skyboltwings-2014-09-01/">In the previous post, I said that it is supposed to be a touch larger profile than the tip wing rib</a>; but that ended up not being the case -- in fact, it's a touch smaller and somewhat &quot;hides&quot; in the aileron well area. I decided not to mess with that...</p>
