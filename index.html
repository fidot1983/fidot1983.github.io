<hr class="dashed"/><p>About a week after engine start (yep, I took a break), back at the airport, and looking over the motor again, trying to
figure out what the hell was that electrical type smell...</p>
<p>One theory formed...</p>
<p>You see, I hung the exhaust with copious amounts of anti-seize. I do have either a Grumman or a Cessna style exhaust,
with 4 &quot;stubs&quot; (aka risers) coming off of the motor, and a &quot;spider&quot; looking setup hooking to them, joining all cylinders
into a muffler under the front of the motor.</p>
<p>Risers go inside the main exhaust, and are held by clamps, engaging &quot;beads&quot; on the pipes.</p>
<p>So I thought, I'd hang the whole thing &quot;loosely&quot;, so that individual cylinders will move, and use high-temp anti-seize to make sure
it, well, doesn't seize up.</p>
<p>The working theory was that that anti-seize was &quot;cooking&quot; and produced a smell. I saw a lot of it blown out from around the clamps.</p>
<p>Another working theory was that maybe there was an insect or few stuck around the baffles or cylinders somewhere. There was one
big wasp in there that I saw after the engine start - and smoldering insect carcasses sometimes smells just like burning wiring.</p>
<p>I know that last bit, because I spent insane amount of time, and got aggravated to no end, when I got this weird
electrical burning smell in my old house. I was convinced I hit a wire when hanging some stuff to the studs just a few
days before, and I literally drilled holes along every place where I hung things with a hole saw to make sure there were no wires.</p>
<p>There was one, but it wasn't pinched or damaged.</p>
<p>And all that was finally traced to a <em>roach</em> that died inside my air conditioner heat exchanger, right on a heat strip - heating
season just started, the roach was dead and smoldering, and the AC was blowing that lovely smell all over the house. I later read a lot of fire department stories about similar situations of people freaking out and thinking their houses were on fire.</p>
<p>At any rate. My theory was either the wasp, or the anti-seize.</p>
<p>And my anti-seize blew out of the joints real well (ha!) - sooo.. I guess, the loose hanging exhaust idea was a no go.</p>
<p>And, by the way.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2020-10-16-exhaust/e-2.jpg" title="Crack!" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2020-10-16-exhaust/e-2-thumb.jpg" title="Crack!" alt="Crack!" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Crack!</p><p>Damn.</p>
<p>So the exhaust was taken off, again.</p>
<p>After quite some researching, here's what I found.</p>
<p>I had 1 3/4 risers.</p>
<p>Those clamps are ubiquitous Cessna clamps. Part number irrelevant - because...</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2020-10-16-exhaust/e-4.jpg" title="Cessna clamps" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2020-10-16-exhaust/e-4-thumb.jpg" title="Cessna clamps" alt="Cessna clamps" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Cessna clamps</p><p>Grumman also has 1 3/4 risers.</p>
<p>I was convinced I had a Grumman exhaust, because hey, what'd you take: a Cessna or a Grumman? :)</p>
<p>Those clamps are impossible to make to not leak. Forums confirmed by the way. Mr. John F. confirmed, too. Just
think about them for a second - they <em>will</em> leak.</p>
<p>Grumman clamps are a bit different - they have this &quot;liner&quot; that is supposed to act as a gasket.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2020-10-16-exhaust/e-3.jpg" title="Grumman clamp" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2020-10-16-exhaust/e-3-thumb.jpg" title="Grumman clamp" alt="Grumman clamp" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Grumman clamp</p><p>Yep, you guessed. I went Grumman. I don't have any Cessna friends. I have a ton of Grumman friends. You know where my heart lies.</p>
<p>Grumman book does not state anything about hanging the exhaust &quot;loosely&quot;. It states to use Walker AcoustiSeal &lt;part number here that doesn't exist anymore&gt; (of course).</p>
<p>Mr. David Fletcher of Fletchair by the way confirmed that the exhaust needs to be tightened down, and that it's not a usual
problem with it cracking due to differential movement of cylinder heads. Or rather, of course it will crack. But not
all the time - it's perfectly fine.</p>
<p>We spent quite some time with Ben, figuring out the clamps (I was initially reluctant to fully close them because of the liner
deforming too much), and AcoustiSeal. He helped find a catalogue AcoustiSeal with a different part number - 35959 - that is definitely
within the temp range. I decided to use that instead of anti-seize. Researching a bit, it seems to &quot;burn up&quot; and &quot;ash out&quot; forming a
fluffy, powdery type seal.</p>
<p>Cleaned every pipe, put on the new clamps with AcoustiSeal, and tightened them down. That was bad. Really bad. Torque was definitely
excessive to close them, but I had to close them. It's obvious why, too - the OD of the pipe is 1 3/4; the ID of the clamp
is 1 3/4, but the thickness of the steel liner is about 1/64 - so yeah. And my pipes aren't perfectly round, or smooth, either.</p>
<p>But they did close, and they did fine in the end.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2020-10-16-exhaust/e-8.jpg" title="New clamps" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2020-10-16-exhaust/e-8-thumb.jpg" title="New clamps" alt="New clamps" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">New clamps</p><p>I decided to try them. Worst case, I'd go back to Cessna style.</p>
<p>Also, cleaned up around the smoke oil injectors, and put AcoustiSeal there too. You can see one on the picture above.
Re-safetied them a bit better too - the idea Glenn had was that if the main worm clamp failed, the safety wire will at least
hold them in place.</p>
<p>And then, the other question came up that we spent quite a bit of time arguing over with Ben.</p>
<p>What's the torque on the Lycoming exhaust nuts?</p>
<p>It's not listed. Stud driving torque is listed. It's listed for  <em>vertical</em> and <em>geared</em>  motors in relevant sections of SSP-1776 at 160-180.
Grumman book lists them at .. 110-140 if I recall correctly. The &quot;by the book&quot; application of &quot;default torque unless otherwise noted&quot; section of the &quot;Direct Drive Engine&quot; part would put it at 204-228. All inch pounds. So the range, depending on the source, would be 110-228 - a 100% difference. !!!</p>
<p>A lot of folks on the internet use the &quot;default&quot; - 204-228. A few were told to do so by Lycoming. When I torqued them, it felt...
somewhat excessive, given that there's a gasket in play there too. There's no straight answer, really.</p>
<p>I settled on 180. Why? Grumman's book assumes &quot;beaded&quot; - not &quot;no-blow&quot; - gaskets. 180 is much closer to 204. 12% difference - within
margin of error of a crappy typical torque wrench. And if mine is reading &quot;high&quot;, I'll still be in the range listed for geared and vertical motors - which have the same cylinders as far as I know.</p>
<p>Yep, convoluted.</p>
<p>Anyway, second run yielded a very different smell - this time, of the regular &quot;burning oil&quot; sensation (which is typical for a motor that slowly weeps oil and throws it everywhere when shaking - that's the built in feature of spray lubrication and corrosion protection of your motor compartment! What? You weren't aware of that?!).</p>
<p>Much better. No blowouts of sealant anymore. No exhaust leaks I could discern.</p>
<p>... and, an oily fitting that I thought was oily after the first run because we used it to pour oil into the oil pump - but no,
I confirmed a hose leak around the fitting of the only two hoses (oil cooler supply and return) I did <em>not</em> change.</p>
<p>Le sigh.</p>

<hr class="dashed"/><p>And so, we're onto the race to the first motor run. I am writing this about a month later - according
to the log, the motor was started up September 19, 2020.</p>
<p>But first...</p>
<div class="section" id="upfront">
<h2>Upfront</h2>
<p>Finish mounting the starter was no problem: clean up the threads, clean up the studs, torque, done.
Then, the alternator.</p>
<p>Belt tensioning... too annoying by hand, but it took me a while to stop trying and become sensible.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Belt Tensioning</p><p>You gotta safety two bolts over there, and I decided to make it nice: for the bottom (pivot) bolt, drilled a tiny
hole in the bracket lower than where the alternator would be, and for the top bolt attaching the bracket to the
motor... hmmm...</p>
<p>Somewhere on VansAirforce someone used a cherry rivet as a &quot;hookup&quot; point for the safety wire. I thought to one-up
that, and use a short #8 screw - drilling it's head.</p>
<p>Frankly, I didn't think it'd work out.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Drilled cap head</p><p>...but as you can see, it did.</p>
<p>So then, to the hole in the bracket. I needed a #8-32 tap.</p>
<p>Side, fun, story: quite a while ago I ended up bidding in a machine shop liquidation auction. Got quite a few nice things, including a very heavy duty bandsaw - and, <em>accidentally</em>, a massive cabinet full of tooling. Anything you could imagine: inserts, drills, taps, slitting saws, you name it. In all shapes and sizes. When we moved the cabinet, we emptied it into about 10 boxes, so ...  I <em>did</em> have a #8-32 tap. In fact, probably about 20 of them. Question was, which one of the boxes were they in.</p>
<p>... apparently, in the one on the top. Hmm. This kind of luck is unusual.</p>

   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2020-10-15-start/s-6-thumb.jpg" title="Tap" alt="Tap" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Tap</p><p>Look at it carefully. Does it look like a regular tap we are all used to?</p>
<p>Didn't to me either.</p>
<p>So to researching we went.</p>
<p>Aha! &quot;Threadforming&quot; tap. AKA &quot;Cold Rolling&quot;. So <em>that's</em> how they're done. Rolled threads are formed into the metal rather than cut; giving them superior strength. Basically, the tap shapes the metal, displacing it in the valleys and raising peaks.</p>
<p>Company that made these taps was advertising them for CNC milling. Well, what's a human if not a bio-CNC machine?!</p>
<p>Okay, problem number 2. I was pretty sure normal tap and drill chart values for hole diameters won't work; making too
small a hole. Hmm...</p>

<h2>Airbox</h2>
<p>That thing needed to be put back on, and carb final torqued with a new gasket. Cleaned it all up inside as much as I could, and had to cut a couple of special gaskets that I can't for the love of me figure out where to get (carb's base
is different size from the top - and this is an &quot;airframe&quot; problem - read, &quot;no standard part from Marvel or Lycoming I could find reasonably&quot;). No problem. Used the same material Lycoming used for their gaskets, ordered from McMaster, and made me a couple.</p>

Glenn had it on when he put on the Rotec TBI, and in the times of my research of TBIs, I have discovered that some folks claimed they helped on carbureted motors as well. Well, it definitely won't hurt - aside from my having to do two gaskets instead of one. No biggie.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="carb">
<h2>Carb</h2>
<p>One interesting thing that happened. I had to drain the carb bowl of all the preservative oil, and flush it, so I took
off the plug, drained it, and started putting it back in. Plug's an NPT thread with torque listed by Lycoming in SSP-1776 at 144 inch pounds.</p>
<p>Hmmm.. I noticed it was going in way deeper than it was in before, and way &quot;harder&quot; than when I took it out.</p>
<p>Hmmm.. Well, it's Lycoming, they know what the hell they're talking about. So in it went, at 144 inch/lbs.</p>
<p>But this bugged me. I think some other day I pulled out the Marvel's manual. 25-30 inch/lbs?! WHAT?!</p>
<p>Back to Lycoming. 144. Marvel (the makers of the carb)? 25-30. Damn it. Forums? Nothing interesting.</p>
<p>I finally figured it out. In SSP-1776, in the table for special torques, Lycoming lists the plug to have 3/4 pipe threads. Mine were 1/8 NPT. Lycoming's torque for those is 40-44 inch/lbs. Still higher than Marvel, but much closer now.</p>
<p>So, I undid the plug, that cut a bit of the tapered thread &quot;deeper&quot;, of course. And put it back in, with the right torque this time.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="other-stuff">
<h2>Other Stuff</h2>
<p>And then, minor stuff here and there. Cleaned and prepped spark plugs. Put the exhaust back on. Tightened things that
had to be tightened. Charged batteries. Tied up everything hanging loose. Gave the plane a good look all over.</p>
<p>We were ready for the final day. There were a number of things I needed two sets of hands for, and I had just the
man lined up.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="day-x-or-september-19-to-be-precise">
<h2>Day X - or, September 19, to be Precise.</h2>
<p>My buddy Mr. N. agreed to help, and be my observer and fireman (just in case). Mr. M. was extremely inquisitive about
how we're gonna be putting out a burning airplane, and I had to explain a number of times that the goal of
an exercise of starting a motor that's been idle for a year is not to have it go ablaze, and having a
fire watch nearby is a part of prudence, not expectations. He seemed to have been
disappointed. I would be too, if I was 5.</p>
<p>So, on a nice Saturday, we went to the airport.</p>
<p>First, drained all the pickling oil.
Took off the prop (because we'd have to spin the motor to pressurize the oil lines).
Put the fuel pump back on.
Tightened all new fuel lines, and leak checked them. Mr. M. used my fancy &quot;button with alligator clips&quot; to turn it on.
Put new oil in, primed the oil cooler and pump (and this is fun in this airplane, because there's no oil
filler neck on the motor).
Checked control cable travel, and final cotter pinned them.
Checked brakes again (though we bled them when I finished fixing them up).</p>
<p>Then, came the pressurization, and purging of oil lines, time. Mr. M insisted that he wants to &quot;press the button&quot; -
which would put +12V onto the starter contactor; bypassing my normal starting circuit (latter would make the
left mag hot, and I didn't want that).</p>
<p>I told him to press the button and hold it and not let go till I told him to.</p>
<p>Now, starters with a motor with removed spark plugs are fast, loud, and annoyingly sounding. Mr. M. pressed the button.
Jumped a bit. Grimaced a bit. He clearly didn't expect it. I didn't see it, Nick told me afterwards - I was watching
the oil line. I yelled &quot;Stop&quot; when I saw the oil come out, and looked at Mr. M - who, at that point, was shaking
and at the point of breaking down in tears. But! He didn't let go of the damn button. Man.</p>

<p>... second try: no primer, so I have to pump the throttle a bit.</p>
<p>... she's alive!!!!!</p>
<p>I let the temps go up just a bit, and called N. He confirmed everything seemed to have been fine. We shut down,
and went over every fluid fitting. All good.</p>
<p>Started her back up - I wanted to warm the oil to a reasonable temp and let her circulate for a bit, maybe 30
minutes - to get the juice flowing again.</p>
<p>On the second run, I revved her harder, and smelled something. Smelled like... burnt wiring?
N. went around the engine, all wires, and everything he could see or think was close to being to a hot surface,
or an electrical doodad. No signs of trouble.</p>
<p>We decided to proceed.</p>
<p>She ran just fine. I think we ran for about a total of 30 minutes. Shut her down, dragged her in. Went over the wires
again - all of them. Nothing, all clean. There were no bad indications on any of the electrical instrumentation, either.
So at that time, we left that as a mystery to be solved.</p>
<p>... and with that, we went home. We were tired.</p>

<hr class="dashed"/><p>... and the only bit of wiring left was the gauges at the panel.</p>
<p>It was not interesting in any way - mostly, lots of tying in awkward position.</p>
<p>A lot of stuff had to be done thru the front hole's headrest, while standing on a wing, and trying not to get &quot;tangled&quot; in the
flying and landing wires.</p>
<p>Oh well.</p>
<p>I realized this was another mistake. Since all the gauge wires started at their transducers or sensors (amps, fuel and oil pressures,
oil temp, and the like), I ran them &quot;backwards&quot; as one piece, and was planning to put on the corresponding D-Sub connectors
in place.</p>
<p>What I didn't realize was how much pain it will be if I had to work in close quarters. And unfortunately, the 3-in-1 gauge - with the
fattest of the connectors - required that.</p>
<p>What I should've done was cut the transducer and sensor's wires and made &quot;whips&quot; for them with connectors while on the bench.  Then, I
should've spliced them somewhere on the side of the airplane - yes, I'd have to do a lot of soldering, but that would've been better
than what I ended up having to do...</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Instrument wires - and the back side of 3-in-1</p><p>You can see the DB-15 connector there - that's the 3-in-1. Sticking the wires thru the instrument hole, doing all the stripping and crimping
from the panel side while sitting in the cockpit, and then tying the extra length up... maybe was possible, but seemed to me like it would
be too much extra, producing ugliness and possibly rubbing on the structure nearby, so I decided to make that connector as close to the
actual gauge as I could...</p>
<p>I tried it on the bench first, figuring out where I would put heatshrink, how much of the length is necessary for the connector, and the like.</p>
<p>Another interesting tidbit was that one of the connections had to feed two transducers off of the same one pin. Both wires were 22GA
and I couldn't put them into the pin no matter how I tried - too much wire for one D-SUB pin's barrel. I'll show you the solution I used for that.</p>
<p>So, I bunched up the wires, put a round of heatshrink on, and prepped those power wires.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2020-09-07-wiring-3/w-2.jpg" title="3-in-1 bundle" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2020-09-07-wiring-3/w-2-thumb.jpg" title="3-in-1 bundle" alt="3-in-1 bundle" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">3-in-1 bundle</p><p>I bent the two power wires for transducers backwards &quot;out&quot; of the connector, and pigtailed a single 20ga wire to them. That looped back into
the connector and hooked up to the pin.</p>
<p>Then, I set myself up on the wing, slouching over the front hole's combing, took my stripper,
and stripped a wire... bam! 2/3ds of the strands came off...</p>
<p>What the..?!</p>
<p>I think the stripper pinched the wire when closing on it, and since I was so much out of position - practically upside down - I didn't notice...</p>
<p>And since I effectively just destroyed ~1/2 inch of the wire, and the wires were cut short....</p>
<p>I lucked out. The wire I was stripping was a standalone ground wire. Moreover, I had two more tails coming from the same source - for the other
two gauges, and the unintentionally shortened tail I just made was just the right length for another gauge.</p>
<p>Phew. Only having to cut two knots, I re-routed the shortened wire to the other gauge, and that gauge's wire to the 3-in-1 bundle.</p>
<p>Tested the stripper multiple times. Yes, I think I just missed the right hole.</p>
<p>Making dead sure I was on this time, I tried again - phew. All worked out.</p>
<p>Slowly, everything got crimped.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">3-in-1 gauge pins</p><p>You can also see that &quot;power loop&quot; in the above picture.</p>
<p>Then, I installed the pins in the housing, and checked the 3-in-1 out. Used a plumber's gauge to pressurize pressure transducers with some
appropriate amount of air and made sure the correct arrow went up on the 3-in-1, and by the right amount.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Testing pressure transducers</p><p>The other three gauges were much easier - because they were further from the 3-in-1 and tie point, for each of them I could trim and crimp
the wires from the cockpit side. I had some fun times with the housing of the tach connector - a DB-9... UMA shipped me a weird sheet metal
shell for it I've never seen that I think needs a special crimper to install, so I ended up replacing it with a regular cheapo plastic after spending
what feels like a few hours trying to find out what the hell that shell was... Failed at that.</p>
<p>At any rate.</p>
<p>The final result? Well..</p>

<hr class="dashed"/><p>Well, we're continuing happily with wiring over here :).</p>
<div class="section" id="wingtips">
<h2>Wingtips</h2>
<p>SkyBeacon and SkySensor were to replace the existing nav lights. Yes, I know, SkySensor is probably a gimmick. But what the hell.</p>
<p>Remo ran nav light wires in a -4 tubing along the front wing spar, using it as kind of a &quot;conduit&quot;, exiting the wires around the wingtip,
and just soldering them to the nav lights he used. Wires were ~3 ft too long, which is a fine &quot;service whip&quot;, but they were just laying on top of the
inside of the fabric of the wingtip. There are no access holes on the wingtip, so no way to get in to tie them up.</p>
<p>Oh well. We work with what we have.</p>
<p>I was going to shorten the wires, and because the lights are on the top wing, I didn't want to solder them - I'd be doing it off of a
ladder, very near if not <em>on</em> the wing's fabric... lots of things to go wrong.</p>
<p>The other thing I didn't want to happen was to have the connection points between the light's wire pigtails and wires in the wings to &quot;rattle
around&quot; the wingtip (with no way of tying them down).</p>
<p>So I had this brilliant idea. The pic is post-realizing the idea was a mistake, with HST cut off....</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2020-09-06-wiring-2/w-1.jpg" title="SkySensor, and cut off HST" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2020-09-06-wiring-2/w-1-thumb.jpg" title="SkySensor, and cut off HST" alt="SkySensor, and cut off HST" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">SkySensor, and cut off HST</p><p>The lights had this plastic tube coming out thru which the wires were routed. I would shorten the pigtails as much as I could (like on the picture
basically), hook'em up to the wing wires with barrel crimps, and put a long piece of my favorite glue-lined SCL tubing over them - with
it glueing itself to the plastic tube and to the wires, creating one rigid &quot;tube&quot; coming off of the light...</p>
<p>Boy was that a mistake.</p>
<p>The tubing glued itself to the wires alright - but not to the plastic tube. So the whole thing created a rattly &quot;lever&quot; that would pull the
wires thru that tube when vibrated - loading the soldered joints on the PCB of the SkySensor.</p>
<p>Not Good At All.</p>
<p>So that idea had to go to trash, and I had to cut the heatshrink off, carefully, with all the glue, without damaging the wires...</p>
<p>And ended up having to do exactly what I was trying to avoid - having rattling connections between the wing wires and the
light, and to solder them. Why solder? Well, because the barrel crimps are heavy, relatively speaking, and I didn't want those heavy &quot;bumps&quot;
bouncing around inside the wingtip, even with HST around them.</p>
<p>So, solder.</p>
<p>From the ladder, on top of the wing, covered in fabric.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Let there be light!</p><p>The other fun part? On the left side, Remo had standard 6-32 tapped holes in whatever the backing of the light socket for the navlight was
made out of. I couldn't really see - maybe a nutplate, maybe just tapped sheet metal.</p>
<p>But on the right side, he used sheet metal screws. Which, of course, I didn't know about till I started putting the lights on - because I
took apart the left side when checking if SkyBeacon will fit, and assumed the other side would be exactly the same. As usual, rookie mistake.
By now, I should know to check everything.</p>
<p>Well, that was a minor delay. Spruce / AN standard doesn't have screws with the right size head (#6 AN screws have heads too large to
fit on the SkyBeacon and SkySensor), so McMaster-Carr had to be resorted to to get the right size and length sheet metal screws.</p>

<div class="section" id="p-leads">
<h2>P-Leads</h2>
<p>The Charger has the Bendix mags, and the P-lead connectors on those are not ring-terminated; instead, using a &quot;screw in&quot; type deal.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2020-09-06-wiring-2/w-2.jpg" title="Bendix type p-lead connector - old wire" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2020-09-06-wiring-2/w-2-thumb.jpg" title="Bendix type p-lead connector - old wire" alt="Bendix type p-lead connector - old wire" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Bendix type p-lead connector - old wire</p><p>Basically, the shielded wire goes thru the outer bushing. The ferrule is a &quot;T&quot;-shaped sleeve, and shield get spread out over the &quot;shank&quot; of the
T. It's squished between the outer bushing's base and the &quot;flat&quot; of the T of the inner ferrule.</p>
<p>The center wire goes thru an insulating spacer (that brown piece), and thru a washer on the other end - with a &quot;button&quot; of solder built on
top of the washer to create a contact point.</p>
<p>The whole contraption gets screwed into the mag's receiving hole with the nut - ferrule rests against the mag's casing, pushing on the insulator
and the solder button to contact the contact point inside the mag, while the nut pushes on the outer bushing and clamps the shield between
it's base and the inner ferrule.</p>
<p>Now, that works with something like 16GA wire, and it's too big with my small 20GA P-leads. Also, notice how beat up the shield on that
setup is? That's the old P-lead.</p>
<p>Folks make adapters for these to go to ring terminals, but they run something like $100 per, which is just silly, so I was determined to
make this work.</p>
<p>Here was my idea, and what it looked like on the right mag. Note <em>two</em> P-lead wires - one of them goes to the front cockpit's tach.</p>
<p>We pigtail the shield.</p>

by .010 too small, to fit over that layer.</p>
<p>Damn.</p>
<p>After playing with various heatshrinks for the outer layer, and trying to slide the bushing on while the HST was hot, I gave up, and...</p>
<p>... just enlarged the hole in the bushing. Yes, I know. The bushing seems to be CAD plated, and I surely took it off (the bushing was magnetic). We'll see how it fares -
if I see rust, I can always buy the adapters for silly prices.</p>

<h2>FWF, finishing up</h2>
<p>And then, the rest of FWF. The only other interesting tidbit was my thinking about the Starter Warning light wire. It's one that goes off of
the &quot;I&quot; terminal of the starter contactor - which goes &quot;hot&quot; when the starter contactor closes - to indicate &quot;starter engaged&quot; with
a light. The whole shebang is probably superficial, but I convinced myself that I wanted it if for nothing else than to maintain &quot;symmetry&quot;
of lights on my panel.</p>
<p>Silly.</p>
<p>Anyway, that wire needed a fuse - though it's an intermittent wire, and I'll admit to thinking about maybe not having a fuse on it,
decided to do it, because it wouldn't harm a thing.</p>
<p>Used a 1A &quot;legged&quot; type PCB mount fuse there.</p>

<hr class="dashed"/><p>Well, damn. With almost a year (no, more than a year!) of my being a caretaker of the Chickenhouse Charger, I
finally was about to actually begin what I have started - which was, putting in <em>my</em> wires.</p>
<p>I decided to start at the switches, and run from the panel forward. Some wires will terminate at the fuse blocks
(power feeds), and some will go forward - to the front panel, voltage regulator, and firewall forward.</p>
<p>Then, I was planning to run a few wires backwards - the ones that were pre-terminated on my transducers (fuel,
oil pressures, oil temp, and mag pickup for the tach).</p>
<p>Immediately, I will admit: <strong>that was a mistake</strong>. While the harness turned out alright, it could've been
much neater - if I ran in one direction. I could've made sure the whole thing is wire to wire and perfectly
clean. So I should've run front to back, because my pre-terminated wires all &quot;started&quot; upfront.</p>
<p>In other words, prop to tail. Well sigh. Next time. On the other hand, this approach would've made terminating
switches at the panel a nightmare. That was, initially, the reason why I wanted to start at the panel - so that
I'd pre-attach wires to switches, tie them up, and then trim them at the other end.</p>
<p>At any rate.... Shall we?</p>
<div class="section" id="prep">
<h2>Prep</h2>
<p>Couple things to knock off before I started wiring was to complete the back panel. One thing that was
left was the compass correction card bracket. No problem, drilled and tapped a couple holes for #2 brass screws.</p>
<p>Here's Mr. M. installing it:</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Compass Correction Card Bracket</p><p>The other one was the inertia switch for the smoke system. Glenn had it in for &quot;safety&quot;: in the event of a
shock (crash?) the switch breaks the circuit. I am.. not sure why he would have it, but he had it.</p>
<p>I considered not putting it back in, but what the hell.</p>
<p>Here's the switch:</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2020-07-26-wiring-1/w-1.jpg" title="Shock switch" >

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Shock switch</p><p>The problem was, it sat tightly between other switches in the panel. With old layout, that barely worked; but with
the new layout, and Honeywell double throw switches, the connector plug was getting in the way. So I had to resort
to some vandalism. :)</p>

<div class="section" id="panel">
<h2>Panel</h2>
<p>Now ready, I decided to install the switches first, and then wire them from the back. I needed a couple short jumpers
though to connect them, and to set up some wires to be the exact length. That'd be impossible with switches
installed in the panel (too little access), so I set up an old placard plate, installed switches into it,
and worked on those jumpers and terminations on the bench before moving them to the airplane.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Somewhere in the middle of running the wires</p><p>I think it happened when I was yet again sitting in the cockpit, clicking the switches and enjoying the very

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Engine starter engaged position - note that I can hit the starter and hold the throttle with the same hand</p><p>...when it dawned on me...</p>
<p>My three most important switches, L and R Mags, and Master, were set up with lockouts - you couldn't turn them on
just by clicking them, instead, having to pull the lever first to move it to the &quot;on&quot; position. I mostly
did that to protect from accidental too playful a kid in the cockpit.</p>
<p>But they weren't locked out in the &quot;on&quot; position!</p>
<p>Why is that important? Well, the Smoke and the Fuel Pump - the most <em>operated</em> switches on this plane - are
right there. Note how their levers are shorter? If I accidentally hit the longer levered Master, or a Mag, switch,
that would turn it <em>off</em> - with me potentially shutting down the motor. While a remote possibility, improving
the situation would amount to just replacing the switches to the ones with lockouts in <em>both</em> on <em>and</em> off positions.</p>
<p>I don't know how I missed that when designing the original setup...</p>
<p>I decided to do it.</p>
<p>So out came the switches, I had to un-wire the terminals from the back. In went the order for three new
switches with now correct lock-outs.</p>
<p>About a week later, I had them, and could proceed.</p>
<p>With left side wired up, I could tie it down. Mind you, access there is tight and from all kinds of
weird angles :).</p>

I had firewall, motor, &quot;side conduit&quot;, and panel, as ground points - all bonded with those straps.</p>
<p>Here's the right side:</p>

<p>I also had some fun with ADELs right where the wires turn from the &quot;side conduit&quot; towards the panel.
I had to clear and negotiate a couple bowdens, and the engine monitor harness was unwieldy.</p>
<p>I think that took a number of hours, just trying various setups, the final one that I really liked was this:</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Engine monitor and carb heat bowden.</p><p>I replaced all the ugly zipties with lacing, of course :).</p>
<p>Meanwhile, on the outside, to keep the wires nicely separated, I spread them out in kind of a &quot;fan&quot; in the order
they ran, back to front:</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Wire fan</p><p>A day later, I replaced the tape with a comb. Yep, a cheapo $1 comb :) Worked out great.</p>
<p>And finally, before committing and continuing, I checked each wire for gauge, and proper circuitry.</p>

<h2>Side Contuit, Part I</h2>
<p>With all those wires sticking out, it was now time to start figuring out routing in the side conduit. All the wires
that had to go forward had, well, to go forward.</p>
<p>After lots of fiddling, I ended up with this:</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Initial stab at the side conduit routing</p><p>I had to clear all the brackets, and other sharp things. Ended up adding a couple more ADELs (and drilling holes

<p>The most interesting piece in it was a Westach tach, that fed directly off of a P-Lead and required a .25A
fuse. Glenn used a 1A classic glass fuse, but I decided to do it right. See, the thing is, if it fails &quot;short
circuit&quot;, that'd turn off the mag - I guess that's why the fuse is in there.</p>
<p>The tach would get another 20GA shielded wire, just like a p-lead, and I decided to join it to right mag's
p-lead at the magneto - instead of splicing it into the p-lead running front to back in the side conduit.</p>
<p>But, back to the fuse. I figured, I'd build it into my connector that hooks up to the tach. Then, if blown,
the connector could be rebuilt. Yep, it's more annoying than a regular replaceable fuse, but that circuit is
not critical, and I had no room for a &quot;regular&quot; fuse block or holder.</p>
<p>So I got me a &quot;legged&quot; .25A fuse with a massive voltage rating (I forget what it was, but definitely above
what a mag makes), and hooked it to a regular Molex pin.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">On the tach</p><p>The lead is just a regular pigtailed P-lead, of course. Notice how I like using SCL around individual Molex pins
for added strain relief - that's because I can't produce good Molex crimps that I like; and I end up post-soldering
them in addition to crimping. That strain relief ensures that soldered joint is firmly held immobile. Takes a bit
of extra time, but I actually like that better than straight Molex crimps.</p>
<p>The rest of the front panel wasn't interesting, just annoying. There's only three circuits there: nav lights wires
from the left wing run along the back of the panel to the right side where the conduit is, and then there's hobbs
and tach, and that's it. It was just very annoying: with very little access, not being able to see things,
and, being in the front hole, having to climb out and in every time I needed a tool I forgot to put close (when
in the back hole, I can roll up a cart to it and have all my tools there).</p>
<p>Mirror was absolutely required.</p>

<h2>Firewall Forward</h2>
<p>The final set of wires to join the main harness were all the wires coming from the firewall side - mainly,
transducers and other instrumentation wires, but also a couple wires for the voltage regulator.</p>
<p>This was precisely when I realized the mistake I talked about in the beginning - and ended up with less
neat, and more tortured harness. Oh well.</p>
<p>I started up front, trimming and terminating my fat wires for the starter and alternator B-feed. Some more extreme
soldering (to cap them), this time with a torch.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2020-07-26-wiring-1/w-77.jpg" title="More extreme soldering" >

 </a> <p class="small text-center">More extreme soldering</p><p>I tied up, and clamped the fat bundle to the motor: and apparently, didn't take a single picture.</p>
<p>Then, I had to figure out the diode for the Starter contactor - first of, it needed longer leads. There, instead
of soldering, I used small barrel crimps from Molex along with heatshrink (I do use them where soldering is
impractical, and I decided not to have soldered joints FWF).</p>

<p>I <a class="reference external" href="http://79ft.net/entries/2019-06-18-fuselinks/">tested them a while back</a>, and am confident they'll work.</p>
<p>First, we take a wire 4 &quot;gauge steps&quot; thinner than the fused one (so 24GA for 20GA fused, etc). That goes
into the &quot;source&quot; terminal.</p>

them later.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="tail-light">
<h2>Tail Light</h2>
<p>I got rid of the belly strobe on the plane, because it was too heavy and too.. useless. Wingtip lights are gonna be the SkyBeacon
and SkySensor from uAvionix (my ADSB mandate compliance :) ), and they have strobes: but they're not visible from the back. So
I decided to replace the tail nav light with an LED nav/strobe.</p>
<p>Problem number one: no ground wire going to the tail light. For whatever reason, Remo decided to basically use the fact that the
tail light is hooked up to the rudder with a pair of screws thru sheet metal of the rear rudder bow... I don't even want to begin to think what
the ground path would be: hinges? control cables?</p>
<p>So, I needed a second wire.</p>
<p>Problem number two: it had to be one neat cable, and it had to be of a smallish diameter (Remo had an old 20GA wire, which is thicker
than modern 20GA tefzel wire).</p>
<p>I decided to use a chunk of  20GA shielded - same ones I used for p-leads. Technically I guess you're not supposed to do that, but it's
very far from all the antennas and I'm crossing my fingers that it won't create too much problems. Thickness was spot on.</p>
<p>So, I soldered the new piece to the old wire, and fished it thru using old wire as a pull. That part was scary - if that didn't
work, I would've had to cut holes in the rudder to get a new wire thru.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">All hooked up!</p><p>On the other end (on the tail fin side) the wire went into a hole on the inspection cover, and had to join the wire coming from the front.
And I had to have the ground there. You can see that area right behind the elevator on the &quot;fishing wire thru&quot; picture.</p>
<p>Problem number three: <em>nothing</em> to hook up the ground to in that area. The only option I figured out  was to use one of the rivnuts that are
attached to the tabs welded to the frame, hoping that there's no corrosion there between the aluminum rivnut and steel fuselage. I figured I'd
use a way too long a screw thru one of the rivnuts when attaching that inspection cover, and then pull the ring terminal onto it, and secure it
against the back side of the rivnut with a nut and a washer. Ugly? Yes; but I didn't have any more options. Really, the right way to do that
would be to run two wires from the pilot panel all the way back, but.. I'd have to start cutting fabric for that.</p>
<p>So, I attached the positive to the wire that was already there, terminated my ground, hooked everything up, hooked up some power, and...</p>
<p>Nothing.</p>
<p>A bit of debugging showed that... ground was the problem. Damn! I picked the wrong rivnut, I guess - it had corrosion.
The one right on the other side though showed the right voltage when measured against the positive lead, so I just moved everything to the
other side, and...</p>

<p>First, conduit, cockpit side. Lots of crossing things, lots of padding for bowdens where they cross the wires (I used the right
sized vinyl tubing from my local friendly Aerospace Depot, and lacing to tie it).</p>
<p>Engine monitor harness got covered in tube for quite a distance - there was no way to keep it off and not rubbing on the conduit.</p>

money on shipping small-headed #10 screws (the screws in the terminals are #8 but with small &quot;oval&quot; rather than &quot;pan&quot; aviation style head,
so I'd have to get me some decent screws from McMaster.. by the time I'd be done, it'd be close to those $35).</p>

<hr class="dashed"/><p>This was a small project to wrap up everything I could do firewall forward before moving on to the panel and main wiring.</p>
<p>I wanted to clean up the engine monitor probes harness. When Glenn installed it, he used zipties everywhere (and actually
everything on the plane was ziptied). Nothing wrong with that, except where zipties were used around motor mount and the like
without any cushioning.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2020-05-01-probes/p-1.jpg" title="Probe wires with zipties" >

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Probe wires with zipties</p><p>But last I checked, zipties weren't used in the 1930s. No, in the 1930s grass was greener, trees taller, water wetter,
and Real Men used wire lacing to tie their wiring harnesses together.</p>
<p>And using adel clamps on round tube is just good karma.</p>
<p>So, I re-did one side first.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2020-05-01-probes/p-2.jpg" title="Properly laced and mounted" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2020-05-01-probes/p-2-thumb.jpg" title="Properly laced and mounted" alt="Properly laced and mounted" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Properly laced and mounted</p><p>Much better isn't it? Those wing nuts are temporary - I will replace them all with real ones when finishing up FWF much later.</p>
<p>I did the other side, though didn't tie it up yet - there will be more wires joining that branch later, and I had to wait until
they were done. But, I did set up all the adel clamps - about 4 pairs of them total.</p>
<p>Next, came the carb temp probe. I had to extend it's wire, and hook it back into the main harness. I repositioned it a long time
ago because I ditched the Rotec TBI, and the old wire was just a touch too short.</p>
<p>I spent quite a bit of time making sure that it's a thermocouple, and that I can reliably extend it - with same material and type
thermocouple wire. I did some basic tests with extending it and making sure it shows reasonable numbers. It did.</p>
<p>I thought a couple times about ditching it; but decided to keep it if I could, and my tests showed that I could do that.</p>
<p>Mounting and routing ended up looking something like this:</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2020-05-01-probes/p-3.jpg" title="Carb temp probe wire" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2020-05-01-probes/p-3-thumb.jpg" title="Carb temp probe wire" alt="Carb temp probe wire" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Carb temp probe wire</p><p>From there, it'd go straight to the motor mount (towards the firewall), and join the engine monitor harness.</p>
<p>When extending the thermocouple, the easiest thing to do is make sure that the joining thermocouple wires mesh together - this
way, you're not introducing a section of a dissimilar metal between two segments.</p>
<p>To do that, I used simple Molex &quot;barrel&quot; butt splices that allow you to put one wire on top of another and crimp around. You
then heatshrink the joint. In fact, I'm starting to like them, and am thinking about using them instead of the usual AMP butt
splices with nylon insulation. They are much cleaner and compact, and heatshrink I use here (SCL) provides ample
strain relief (it shrinks to hard plastic, and glues itself to the wire).</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Extension being put on</p><p>I shrunk each crimp individually, and then another chunk around the whole thing. The whole thing was set up to be held by a

<p>Back when I <a class="reference external" href="http://79ft.net/entries/cgr-30/">installed the CGR-30</a> on the Cheetah, I encapsulated all the
probe wires into fiberglass sleeve, and here it'd fit perfect - to support the lonely wire spanning about a foot to the motor mount.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Fiberglass sleeve</p><p>I also used CGR's &quot;barrel connectors&quot; to hook up to the harness end. They have the wires &quot;mesh&quot; together, and fix them with a
grubscrew, making the whole thing removable. Not sure when I'd want to do that, but I wanted to have an option.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Barrel connectors hooking up to the main lead</p><p>Before closing it up, I tested everything. The probe had to be in the carb, so the best I could figure was to check if the ambient

very close to the adel clamp holding the fiberglass sleeve to the airbox, on the right side - and remember, it's in hard plastic
that the heatshrink that's under the fiberglass sleeve turned into - so I'm not concerned about the joint failing there.</p>

<p>There were some more holes left after removing some old things. They were for #6 or #8 screws; and I could barely access the other

<p>Instead of attempting to maneuver nuts back there, I wanted to try something along a rivnut.. but a bit better. Steel.</p>
<p>Spruce sells these steel &quot;nutserts&quot;, which seemed to fit the bill. Got a set, with install tooling.</p>

<h2>Fat Wires</h2>
<p>The contactors got mounted and torque sealed (of course I forgot to add a diode jumper to the starter contactor, will have
to add later). Next, came figuring out the alternator wire and battery contactor -&gt; shunt jumper (main buss feeder from the battery
basically).</p>
<p>Initially, I thought I could route the alternator wire on the right side of the motor; keeping the starter on the left (remember,
the firewall layout on this plane is reversed of sorts - with battery and oil cooler having their locations swapped and producing
all sorts of grief due to that).</p>
<p>While not bad, holding the alternator wire on the firewall would've required more holes, and it'd go straight down, at
90 degrees to the main harness on the firewall (going left to right), kinda &quot;crossing&quot; it under. So I gave that idea up pretty quick,
instead deciding to run it along that main harness - neatness and 1 less hole/clamp instead of a shorter by about a foot run.</p>

<p>Mr. Max made a comment that it's the music that's distracting me (he was busy building his &quot;water system&quot; out
of the old fuel system hoses and fittings <a class="reference external" href="http://79ft.net/entries/2020-04-29-hosed/">I took out</a> at the time).</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">The initial setup</p><p>I did not like this. See how tight that Master &lt;-&gt; Starter contactor jumper is? It was very tight. The rigid alternator wire
hooked into the ring on the master contactor side was too tight too (that adel clamp that I needed to hold stuff under the
starter contactor had to be there - there will be other wires bundled there later). It was so tight that it bent the ring
when I attempted to set it up.</p>
<p>No, that wasn't good at all.... hmmm..</p>
<p>Aha! I did a similar trick with the gascolator! <a class="reference external" href="http://79ft.net/entries/2020-04-29-hosed/">Reverse the flow</a>.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Flow reversed starter contactor</p><p>Much better! All I did was swapped the jumper from the Master contactor, and the starter lead on the starter contactor; and, while
that made the fat red wire jumper much longer, it made the whole setup much, much cleaner. It made the buss feed wire a bit less pretty,
arguably, with that weird &quot;dip&quot;, but there's no avoiding it. I'll live with that.</p>

torch, and add &quot;solder caps&quot;.</p>

<h2>Ground Strap</h2>
<p>This plane didn't have any. The battery was grounded to the motor (good - the biggest current demand is from the starter). The motor
wasn't grounded to anything else at all, making the current flow thru probably the control cables and fuel hoses to the rest of
the plane. Not good.</p>
<p>So, one was needed. That took more thinking and fiddling. I had a plan initially to ground the battery to the motor and the
motor mount (Grummans do something similar - battery to firewall; and motor mount to motor) - but I wasn't sure about
how good a connection there is between the motor mount and the firewall. So I decided to jump the motor to the firewall -
a very common setup.</p>

<p>Battery leads were easy to make. Had to fiddle a bit with grommets (holes in the box are much larger than wires, and I had to
use a &quot;hose section around a wire in the grommet&quot; trick to keep the wire tight and nice.</p>
<p>The battery box was another matter though.</p>
<p>Glenn had replaced the original large (&quot;standard&quot;) battery with a small Odyssey - and took out the space with a bunch of chunks
of random foam...</p>

drain - setup for an old school battery that could leak acid). Those dimples were sized for a full size battery, so Odyssey couldn't stand on them.</p>
<p>So, .. ahem.. the solution was?</p>

<p>I hooked up the leads, routed them out of the box, and closed it up, only to realize that the battery was loose in the &quot;up and down&quot;

battery to hit the top and be bouncing if the airplane all of a sudden went to &lt;0G (in turbulence, trivially possible - and
it <em>is</em> aerobatic after all!)</p>
<p>Ordered some foam from McMaster, and padded the top of the box, and the battery sides.</p>

<p>And with that, I moved on. The main layout was done - the rest of tightening, tying, and strapping has to be done when all the
wires are in, close to the end of this rebuild.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Ugly hose.</p><p>There are a few options of course. Pre-fabbed hoses - you gotta measure carefully and they'll be made to the exact sizes you want.
You can buy fittings and make your own. You can go with different styles - integrated silicone firesleeve or &quot;crimp on&quot;, rubber
or teflon, yada yada.</p>
<p>I decided to go with pre-fabbed. I did the math a number of times; and a pre-fabbed hose was cheaper than making my own.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://www.tsflightlines.com/home.html">TS Flightlines</a> has a great reputation on the Biplane Forum, and are pretty much
the go to guys.</p>
<p>So, time to measure!</p>
<p>I had to re-clock the fittings on the engine fuel pump, so I loosened the jam nuts...</p>
<p>What? .... Jam nuts backed off, and fittings won't turn easily?! They should just unscrew!</p>
<p>Fittings moved with a wrench - and I discovered .. my favorite, The White Schmoo of Death. The teflon dope.</p>
<p>For some inexplicable reason, whomever undid the plumbing last time, re-plumbed it with the sealant everywhere. Okay, NPT fittings
need sealant (though, a choice of a crumbly drying type stuff is questionable - because when it's left in a female fitting, getting
it out without it getting it's crumbs into the system is almost impossible). But o-ring boss? Where there's a straight thread fitting
with a nut and an o-ring? No sir! The o-ring seals it just fine! Siiigh.</p>
<p>Here it is. That lovely sealant.</p>

it out of the TBI. Frankly, I was glad I tossed the TBI altogether, hoping that that was the only place I'd
find that sealant... Only to.. Oh well.</p>
<p>I had to take the pump out. No way I could clean out that damn stuff out of the hole w/o getting it all inside.</p>
<p>Slowly and steadily, with the hole pointed down, I scraped and scraped and scraped it with my dental pick, followed with a brush wetted
in Goof Off that kinda softens it. It was.. hours. For two holes.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Clean.</p><p>Phew. The pump went back on, and finally, I could clock the fittings how I wanted them.</p>
<p>I used a few old hoses I had lying around, and chunks of safety wire to mock up my new ones; measured the mockups, and
made a bunch of pictures like this:</p>

<p>Tom, the owner, is the guy who answers the phone. A quick email with pictures, a quick conversation about various hose ends
(we ended up doing a few -3's instead of -2's as I had before), etc etc - and the order was in.</p>
<p>And, a few days later, a box showed up at my door!</p>
<p>Next time at the hangar, I tried them on. The hoses were perfect! But, something I haven't considered before...</p>

   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2020-04-29-hosed/h-21-thumb.jpg" title="Tee to engine pump" alt="Tee to engine pump" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Tee to engine pump</p><p>There's a tee. Right side is connected to the gascolator. Left side - to the electrical pump. Both horizontal sides
of the tee are connected with aluminum tubing. Notice the adel on the right holding onto the flare nut. The adel on the left,
barely visible, is holding onto the <em>tube</em> - motor mount geometry isn't allowing it to grab onto the nut.</p>
<p>And the whole thing is aluminum, and the hose is creating a ton of leverage onto that tee.</p>
<p>It's not the problem with my hose. I should've realized this before I even ventured there. The old hose had the same problem, of course.</p>
<p>Aluminum has fatigue life. The motor shakes. The whole thing shakes, connected by the hose. How that tee didn't crack is...
anyone's guess. On top of that, how the tube didn't crack is even more miraculous.</p>
<p>I showed it to Deene Ogden - one of our Chapter's very experienced guys. He agreed with my hunch. His suggested fix was to attempt
to tie that hose end somehow into the firewall, so that it doesn't create that much leverage.</p>
<p>Well, easier said than done. Firewall on this thing is .035 - and not rigid at all.</p>
<p>I showed it to Tom (the TS Flightlines guy). He thought that even the fact that there's aluminum tubing between firewall
and engine mount is a bad thing - though there the relative motion is small, it still might crack a tube or a flare.</p>
<p>Top that with my general dislike towards the non-firesleeved sections of aluminum tubing firewall forward (I admit, I actually
attempted to figure out a nice way to sleeve them), and incorrectly plumbed fuel transducer (it was on the &quot;suction&quot; side -
before all the pumps - and it <em>is</em> a restriction - and a restriction on a sucking side is a potential for vapor lock) - and I,
in my usual manner, decided to, of course, rebuild the whole thing.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="disassembly">
<h2>Disassembly</h2>
<p>Well, that was easy - except for my favorite white crap everywhere. All the fittings were aluminum, and most of the fittings
weren't AN.</p>
<p>Now, similar to a conversation of which sealant to use on NPT threads (you can start a fight amongst best friends by bringing it up!),
there's a massive holy war on aluminum vs. steel FWF. I am in the steel camp.</p>
<p>And there's another, smaller holy war, about using &quot;racing&quot; fittings. Folks that do say &quot;if it's good for NASCAR, it's good
enough for us&quot;. I don't know. I don't buy that. First of, those fittings are of extremely varying quality (AN level all the way
down to cheap Chinesium). Second, race cars are rebuilt all the time - and in an airplane, I bet some of those are 40 years old. Or 20.
You get the idea.</p>
<p>So I am firmly in the &quot;AN, steel&quot; camp. Even though they are $20 a pop.</p>
<p>Transducer was the hardest to clean out, because I needed to make sure none of that white crud went into it. My friend and hangar neighbor Dick G. suggested running a tap with flutes filled with grease to pick up the crud... hmm... I didn't have the right size
tap, and that sounded a bit too extreme.. but the idea..</p>

<div class="section" id="the-plan-and-the-mockups">
<h2>The Plan, and the Mockups</h2>
<p>So since we're redoing the whole thing; first thing I was gonna do is dump the parallel plumbing of the pumps. I guess,
Remo's idea was that in case the electric pump fails in a mode where it blocks the flow of fuel thru it, the gas
will still be able to go thru the &quot;alternative&quot; branch and still reach the mechanical pump.</p>
<p>Not sure about that. I am very used to Grummans, which are plumbed in series (electrical -&gt; engine pump -&gt; carb),
and I have not heard of a single failure there. I have heard of this type failure on an RV, which used a solid state
Facet pump that Facet tells you not to use on airplanes.</p>
<p>Okay, actually, this whole Facet pump situation is interesting, apparently. Bendix used to make these electrical pumps, but
then Facet bought that part of their business. Nowadays, they explicitly tell you not to use their pumps on airplanes!</p>
<p>But, Dave Fletcher of <a class="reference external" href="http://fletchair.com">Fletchair</a> fame buys batches of particular Facet models, and runs tests on them. He
sells off the ones that don't pass (apparently, flow rates vary wildly), and tags the ones that pass. He then sells them to Grumman
folk.</p>
<p>Hey, good enough for Grumman - good enough for me! I can have my much simpler series system (less hoses, less connections, less
fittings, less space), and trust the pump. And they're cheap! (Well, relatively speaking).</p>
<p>So, I got a pump from Fletch and bolted it on.</p>
<p>Transducer was the next big ticket item. It had to go between the engine driven pump, and the carb - the &quot;last step&quot; in the chain.</p>
<p>I needed something to mock things up. I needed hose ends.</p>
<p>... now, what's with those racing hose ends?</p>
<p>I called Mario - a great guy who fixes my cars when I don't want to :). His thing is drag racing.</p>
<p>He knew a place.</p>
<p>Couple hours later, and with a lighter wallet, I had a bag of fittings that were close enough in size, and a chunk of hose to cut up.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">One of the first x-cer mockups</p><p>This was the first. Followed what Fletcher did on the Cheetah back when we
<a class="reference external" href="http://79ft.net/entries/cgr-30/">installed the CGR-30</a>, but on the Cheetah the hose went back towards the firewall
and did a nice 180 u-turn, and came back to the carb. Here, I had to go &quot;sideways&quot; to do this &quot;hanging&quot; style if I wanted it. It
produced a weird low spot in the loop that I didn't like.</p>
<p>Next!</p>
<p>Could I maybe still have the x-cer on the firewall, and reuse some of the holes?</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2020-04-29-hosed/h-40.jpg" title="Second mockup" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2020-04-29-hosed/h-40-thumb.jpg" title="Second mockup" alt="Second mockup" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Second mockup</p><p>Much better I thought. I ran those by Tom of TS Flightlines. He thought the second setup was better, and recommended using
one of his fancy &quot;u-turn&quot;
fittings to save on the hose length. He gave me dimensions. I realized that I suck at mocking things up, and asked him if he
would be able to send me the fitting (I would gladly pay for it). He said, of course. He could send me whatever fittings I wanted,
and just figure the cost in the end. I'd make mockups and send them to him. Heck, he'd send me the hose too - and I'd cut it to size,
and make the hoses - then send them back to him, and he'll crimp and firesleeve them.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>And he was a treasure trove of information. Basically, hand-held me all the way. And I took it, and am very grateful. This was my
first plumbing job - so I needed the help.</p>
<p>One big fear I had was running bent fittings before and after the transducer, because they can induce turbulence in the flow.
Tom said that they ran them in whichever configuration, and they work fine with the setup he was suggesting. That was a great relief
too.</p>
<p>So, I made my &quot;shopping&quot; list, and he put the fittings in the mail.</p>
<p>I got them, and ran over to the nearby auto parts place to get some hose for the mockup (I decided not to fiddle with cutting
braided teflon hose). The guy took me back, we found the right I.D. stuff. I asked for ten feet. &quot;This is fuel hose, it's expensive&quot;,
said the guy. I asked how much. &quot;Two-something a foot&quot;, was the response.</p>
<p>I almost cracked up. I then told him that the fitting I brought in to check, that one fitting, was probably twice as much as 10 feet
of that hose. We then had a very nice conversation about everything airplanes :).</p>
<p>My final mockup, with fittings from Tom, looked like this:</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">The Final Mockup</p><p>The gascolator hookup looks funny, doesn't it? It's &quot;reversed&quot; - because otherwise, I had no room for hoses at all.</p>
<p>And then, the mock hoses were sent back to Tom for final fabrication.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-gascolator">
<h2>The Gascolator</h2>
<p>Somewhere in between all the mocking up and messing around, I had to figure out what to do with the gascolator. See, it had no
mount. None.</p>
<p>It was basically &quot;hanging&quot; on the fittings coming into each side, and rigid aluminum tubing. Yeah. Ugh. But that's besides the
point - with flexible hoses, it'll be bouncing in that &quot;ring holder&quot; that isn't holding it at all, apparently.</p>
<p>I'll admit, buying a new gascolator with mounting options crossed my mind. But then.. I thought, maybe some kind of latch..</p>
<p>Something that will hook to the bottom of the ring on the gascolator, and the top of that &quot;bracket&quot; and pull it up.</p>
<p>I search McMaster and other catalogues and couldn't find anything... An idea crossed my mind.. maybe..</p>

<p>The diameter of the gascolator's top was a smidge undersized for the ring it was in - Glenn had some kind of a sticky foam
in there. I replaced it with proper, aircraft grade felt :).</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Felt pad</p><p>And then, the drain.</p>
<p>The quickdrain on that bowl was leaking. I found that a looong time ago, and attempted to replace it. Obviously, I had to take
the old one out....</p>
<p>... only to discover that the threads on the bowl were all chewed up.</p>
<p>No problem, thought I, and ordered a new bowl from Spruce.</p>
<p>The threads on that one.. looked even worse.</p>
<p>I contacted Spruce. No problem! They sent me a new one.....</p>
<p>... slightly better, but still chewed up!</p>
<p>Here's one of the pictures I sent to Spruce back then, just for illustration.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2020-04-29-hosed/gask.jpg" title="Bad threads" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2020-04-29-hosed/gask-thumb.jpg" title="Bad threads" alt="Bad threads" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Bad threads</p><p>They said, they will talk to the manufacturer, and have them direct ship one to me. Then, they got silent for a long time, and
then I somehow ended up with two? I think? All with bad threads.</p>
<p>All and all, I ended up with <em>five</em> bowls. That happened almost a year ago, and frankly, I don't exactly remember how exactly the
fifth happend, but I ended up with five.
And Spruce didn't want them back. And they refunded me the money.</p>
<p>But that was then. This was now. Now, I had a tap just the right size, and was set up in the hangar.</p>
<p>This is a 1/8&quot; NPT thread - so tapping it just a hair further would re-cut the bad parts and remove a bit more material, fixing
the threads.</p>
<p>So I took one of the bowls, re-tapped the hole, and started putting in the quickdrain. Ha! Not so easy. There's nothing on the bowl to
grab onto, and I had to tighten the quick drain pretty tight (1 1/2 to 2 turns past hand tight).</p>
<p>I kinda tried to use my vise to help me - holding onto the round thing isn't easy but I tried, using my hand too... Clack! The wrench
slipped, and the bowl went bouncing on the floor.</p>
<p>A bit of damage surveillance showed a nick on the lip where it contacts the rubber seal on the gascolator top, and my better part decided
that I need to be punished and re-do it. Heck, I had FIVE bowls!</p>
<p>So, I tapped the second one. The quick drain went in. It was annoying, but I managed. 1 1/2 turns.</p>
<p>Hmm.. Why does it look so weird... and not work?
Hmm.... Did the torque and compressing the hollow quickdrain with &quot;wedge&quot; action of NPT thread mess it up? Evidently.</p>
<p>But I turned it 1 1/2 turns!!</p>
<p>Idiot me, of course. The 1 1/2 turns is probably too much to begin with (though Vans recommends it in their manual). And besides, they
talk about AN plumbing fittings. Not special fittings like this quick drain.</p>
<p>I googled &quot;Curtiss Quick Drain Torque&quot;... Sure enough. Tiny. 40 inch pounds if I remember correctly. Way to be an idiot, dude.</p>
<p>But I have three more bowls to mess up!</p>
<p>Okay, bowl number three.... tap... attempt to hold... slip.. fall... DING! Damn.</p>
<p>This is stupid, I know. I had to stop and figure out a fixture to hold the bowl while torquing the fitting after the first one
slipped out of the vice (try holding a round object in a vice w/o a fixture?! Idiot). This was the ... &quot;try to get away with it&quot; mode.</p>
<p>Enough. See, I was in such a weird state of mind I didn't take any pictures?</p>
<p>And the solution was simple and right there, of course.</p>

<p>I messed with the transducer a ton. That was another hard part to hold - and I'll admit to bending it's outside box
(that's non-sequitir but annoying). This transducer is weird - it has it's body and it's brains all in a very thin sheet stainless
&quot;box&quot;, making it virtually impossible to hold onto and screw the fitting in. But the bend in that body doesn't affect anything - it's
like a &quot;cover&quot;.</p>
<p>I'll admit to thinking I overtorqued the transducer fittings, too - and removing them to check for cracks (only to find that no,
I actually didn't overtorque them - the manufacturer's spec was higher).</p>
<p>But in the end, it all worked out for the initial hookup. I'll have to tighten everything and clean up the angles on the fittings
a bit when getting closer to the engine start; but the initial fit up worked great. Tom did a great job!</p>

<hr class="dashed"/><p>I've had a problem.</p>
<p>Well, two problems to be precise.</p>
<p>Problem number one: being an <em>alien</em> Texan, I had to ensure that I stay on the good side of our local BBQ police. Did you know
that if you move to Texas, you get deported if you can't pull off a passable brisket on an offset stick burner? You probably didn't!</p>
<p>My other problem was 20 inches wide, 40 inches long, and had a 3&quot; stack.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">My Other Problem</p><p>It was too small, which resulted in inability to make more than one brisket...</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2020-03-21-mean-beast/s-1.jpg" title="Loaded to the brim" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2020-03-21-mean-beast/s-1-thumb.jpg" title="Loaded to the brim" alt="Loaded to the brim" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Loaded to the brim</p><p>That's one brisket and some ribs - and they all are in suboptimal spots on the pit. It's just too small!</p>
<p>My son's fourth birthday I had to admit defeat and get a couple cooked briskets at <a class="reference external" href="https://www.brettsbackyardbarbque.com/">Brett's Backyard BBQ</a>. Nothing wrong with Brett - his briskets are grand; but <strong>I</strong> need to cook for my son's birthday!</p>
<p>On top of that, that pit was all choked up, with such a small stack that it couldn't handle any real size firewood. I ended up having
to fiddle with the fire every 10-15 minutes, and feed it with kindling.</p>
<p>So, after going thru all the smoking for New Years;  I decided that I outgrew my pit, and had to upgrade.</p>
<p>The usual suspects - <a class="reference external" href="https://bbqpits.com/">Klose</a>, <a class="reference external" href="gatorpit.net/">Gator</a>, and <a class="reference external" href="https://pitsbyjj.com/">JJ</a> were all on the list.
They're all in Houston, and I was gonna make a trip on January 2nd, and talk to each one of them. I was thinking about 24x48, and possibly
talking about getting a 30x48.</p>
<p>I considered a <a class="reference external" href="https://www.langbbqsmokers.com/">Lang</a> for a while; but decided against it - I kinda like the simplicity and
basic-ness, if you will, of a straight pit.</p>
<p>And in parallel, I was browsing Craigslist. Hey, if someone was dumping a good sized pit, I would've taken it off their hands.</p>
<p>And that's how I found...</p>
<div class="section" id="tim">
<h2>Tim</h2>
<p>There was a pit for sale that looked basic; but was everything I needed, and for just 1800 bucks. A lot? Well, a 20x40 Klose sells for
more, and this one was 24x60, I think; and <em>on a trailer</em>. It was.. dirt cheap.</p>
<p>It seemed that the guy selling it was in the business of making them. <a class="reference external" href="http://georgetownbbqpits.weebly.com/">He had a website</a>, and there
he said that he can custom build. Hmmmmm... I gave him a call.</p>
<p>... we met the same day. Mr. Tim turned out to be a rancher, welding pits up out of propane tanks as a side gig. &quot;Helps me feed the cows&quot;,
he said. They started as a group of buddies and helped each other make their pits; and then decided to make this into a paying side gig.</p>
<p>Tim's approach was simple and easy; and he was very open to tolerating my obnoxiousness and making a pit for me. We bounced ideas back
and forth, and none of those seemed to scare him too much.</p>
<p>That evening, I went home way over-excited, and started mocking things up ...</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-design">
<h2>The Design</h2>
<p>Just to make sure to illustrate what I wanted from Mr. Tim, I drew the key parts of the pit up in SWX and sent it over to him. We did a few
rounds of back and forth...</p>
<p>I wanted a baffle between the firebox and the cooking chamber that was adjustable from the outside; because I
felt like with that, I wouldn't need to tune it with tuning plates, which are much more annoying to deal with in a hot smoker (moving
them around in a hot smoker is no joke). I played with a baffle a lot on my old smoker, and wanted it easily adjustable on this one too.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2020-03-21-mean-beast/baffle.jpg" title="Baffle" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2020-03-21-mean-beast/baffle-thumb.jpg" title="Baffle" alt="Baffle" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Baffle</p><p>I wanted a &quot;Franklin Style Collector Stack&quot;. Like this:</p>

   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2020-03-21-mean-beast/pipe-thumb.jpg" title="Franklin Style Stack" alt="Franklin Style Stack" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Franklin Style Stack</p><p>I wanted a base on casters and leg levelers. See, I wanted it permanently installed - but I had to install it first; and a monster pit
is no joke weight-wise.</p>
<p>So the idea was, to have casters to move it around, and then remove the casters, and level it with leg levelers in place. So I designed
a funky base arrangement:</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Levelers and base detail</p><p>Mr. Tim was fine with all of those after asking some very pointed, and very good, questions, and offering a lot of suggestions and detail
and his take on things.</p>
<p>We settled on the final design, I put up the deposit, and Mr. Tim proceeded to ...</p>

<h2>Build</h2>
<p>He took about 2 months, which, given that he's a one-man, part time, show, was blazing fast. He was feeding me a good diet of pictures :).</p>

and very sure, he inquired? I said, I thought it was beautiful!</p>
<p>At some point he said that it's <em>the wife</em> who needs to approve, and a wife would not generally approve of an old propane tank in
the backyard being an eyesore.</p>
<p>Well, my wife thought it looked great! :).</p>

all the funky geometry involved - but he offered! Of course!</p>

discussing options on how to hook it up.</p>
<p>He said, he might be ready in a week. I got very excited!</p>
<p>And then, exactly in a week,</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Off the trailer, now to turn and slide in...</p><p>We rolled it to it's final spot, raised one side, dug some holes in the dirt, and put pavers  down to have a solid footing for leg levelers.

cook chamber. It's very important to level the pit right, so that all the grease won't go into the firebox and light on fire!</p>
<p>Next morning, I took an angle grinder to the pit to knock some rust off.
Then, lots of soap, scrubbing, and hosing down. I hurt the day after BTW!</p>

<h2>The Fire!</h2>
<p>I oiled the firebox and lit a blaze to burn off all the bad smell.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Oil patina on the firebox</p><p>That yellow is no rust - it's oil burnt on. Kinda like a cast iron skillet.</p>
<p>I burnt the fire for as long as I could and as hot as I could.</p>
<p>Man, this pit drew! I could throw anything at it. 5-6 large logs? No problem! No choking. It just gets hotter and hotter! Man, what a
beast!</p>
<p>I kept her at about 450-500 for a few hours, and let it die down overnight.</p>
<p>The next morning, I washed the insides out of all the soot from the first fire, oiled the insides, and now went slowly. Now, it was the time
to season the insides with oil, and to do a quick check of temps.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2020-03-21-mean-beast/s-15.jpg" title="Oiled and pretty" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2020-03-21-mean-beast/s-15-thumb.jpg" title="Oiled and pretty" alt="Oiled and pretty" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Oiled and pretty</p><p>My TelTru gauges I've installed into 1/2 NPT ports we welded onto the pit in strategic places were dancing around a happy 250-275. The top
shelf in the middle was hotter with the baffle full open, but the pit evened out when I closed the baffle down a bit to deflect incoming
hot air from the firebox down. It worked! No tuning plates and I'm within 40ish degrees everywhere! Wow. Just.. wow.</p>
<p>I wanted to probe various parts of the pit closer to the firebox. I stuck in my thermocouple probe.... 350. What the hell? Too close?</p>
<p>I was messing around with it, with thermocouple showing me numbers that didn't agree with TelTrus at all. Finally, I did this test.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2020-03-21-mean-beast/s-14.jpg" title="Two probes" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2020-03-21-mean-beast/s-14-thumb.jpg" title="Two probes" alt="Two probes" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Two probes</p><p>The top is a TelTru mechanical gauge. The bottom is the thermocouple. They're within 1 inch of each other.
250 on the TelTru. 330 on the thermocouple. <em>At least one of them is lying</em>. But which one?</p>
<p>Hmm... how does one test a thermometer...? hmm.. aha! Boiling water! That's a nice reference.</p>
<p>Pulled all the 4 TelTrus and my thermocouple, and stuck them in the pot. All of then shown.. 212?! What the hell?</p>
<p>Weird cosmic rays affecting thermocouple crossed my mind, I admit. I talked with Ben. I talked with Alex, and Nick. No ideas.</p>
<p>Dammit!</p>
<p>I had a hunch then. Maybe, just <em>maybe</em>, the stick-out on the mechanical TelTru's was not long enough? To confirm, I did a couple things.</p>
<p>First of, I became somewhat of a aficionado of the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCselvHbb5ah0sEqZrFa-7nA">Mad Scientist BBQ</a> channel,
thru which I found out about <a class="reference external" href="https://fatstacksmokers.com/">Fat Stack Smokers</a>. I checked how long were their stems.
They used 4 inch TelTru's. I was using 2.5 inch ones.</p>
<p>Second, well.. I could confirm which gauge was lying by using paper thermometers - those little strips of paper with squares that turn
black in 10 degree increments.</p>
<p>I ordered some strips, and some 4 inch stemmed TelTru gauges - and meanwhile, decided to do another test - the biscuit check!</p>
<p>That's a fun one. You fire a pit, and fill it with frozen biscuits. You let them sit, and watch the rate at which they brown - to figure
out where the smoker's running hotter, and where it was colder.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2020-03-21-mean-beast/s-16.jpg" title="The Biscuit Test" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2020-03-21-mean-beast/s-16-thumb.jpg" title="The Biscuit Test" alt="The Biscuit Test" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">The Biscuit Test</p><p>With the baffle tuned to where I thought it'd be in the right spot, the test showed almost perfect results! The hottest spot was the middle
of the top shelf. The coldest was the middle shelf near the smokestack. Center middle and top near the smokestack were almost the same, and
all biscuits were reasonably evenly cooked - with crispier side to the firebox. That's the perfect offset distribution!</p>
<p>You see, brisket is thick on one end and thin on the other. The way I feel about it, you want one end to be hit by more heat than
the other. I actually like this temp gradient - if you have the smoker full, bigger pieces can go into hotter spots, and smaller pieces
can go into the colder ones; or you can rotate to cook everything roughly the same amount of time. I feel like that gives one more options
rather than an oven-like perfect environment. One of the reasons I didn't want a Lang BTW.</p>
<p>Those frozen biscuits turned out to taste like baking soda, by the way :(. Oh well. They were dirt cheap.</p>
<p>The following weekend, I set up the temp test with temp strips.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2020-03-21-mean-beast/s-17.jpg" title="The Temp Strips" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2020-03-21-mean-beast/s-17-thumb.jpg" title="The Temp Strips" alt="The Temp Strips" >

 </a> <p class="small text-center">The results</p><p>330! So, it was the TelTru that was lying. My long-stem ones showed up, and I installed them to find perfect indication now.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">4 inch stem on the top</p><p>Now, they agreed within 5 degrees or so. Notice how much further the top, TelTru, probe now protrudes.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2020-03-21-mean-beast/s-20.jpg" title="The TelTru Gauges, in their final spots" >

 </a> <p class="small text-center">The TelTru Gauges, in their final spots</p><p>And so, now, the only thing that's missing is the first cook. Which, by the irony of circumstance, might turn out to be a high-pressure one.
My neighbors' daughter's wedding caterer ditched them, and I very well will very much likely end up cooking for that wedding. Fingers crossed!</p>

<hr class="dashed"/><p>Pressure transducers. Those little doodads that take liquid pressure and transform it into electrical pixies on the
wire...</p>
<p>The ones I got are from <a class="reference external" href="http://umainstruments.com/">UMA</a>. I'm replacing the mechanical engine gauge with
electric - same 3-in-1 (oil temp, pressure, fuel pressure); but the fluids stay under the cowling. Pixies run
in the wires to the gauge and rat those fluids out to it.</p>
<p>Ahem.</p>
<p>Well, this was always a part of the plan:</p>

but still) prevent it from rotating. Plus, a single point of failure - and I am probably over too sensitive to
a probability of dangling fluid hoses with transducers at the end under the cowling in flight.</p>
<p>No sir, we can do better!</p>
<p>Long time ago, I have <a class="reference external" href="http://79ft.net/entries/cgr-30/">installed a CGR-30 onto my Cheetah</a>,
and back then I mounted the transducers on two adels - but those were different style transducers, much longer
than the ones UMA makes.</p>
<p>But they have that threaded &quot;neck&quot; and a nut on it.. hmm... Let's see if we can make some
kind of a bracket?</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Marking the hole</p><p>Start with our good old friend aluminum angle. Now, the &quot;tab&quot; on the bracket will screw with another
adel on the motor mount; that was the idea (so the bracket basically was replacing a second adel around
the transducer that didn't fit). Therefore, the tab off of my bracket would have to be co-planar with the
adel. It did not have to be super precise - I figured, 1/32&quot; of mistake was fine.</p>
<p>A bit of black sharpie transferred the imprint quite nicely.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">The bracket taking shape</p><p>And then, bandsaw and sander. Had to break out my good files to clean up the &quot;fillet&quot; that
remained after cutting off one side of the angle under the nut (otherwise, the nut won't fit).</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Pferd and Grobet, the two buddies at work</p><p>OKay, now, let's add a bit more fanciness to it. Using the nut to draw out circumference and to make sure to
stay well clear for now</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Now, make it "flow"</p><p>This above picture also shows the filed area real well - bottom left.</p>
<p>Finally, need to drill the hole for the adjoining adel in the horizontal portion - that one needs to be somewhat
precise too, if the transducer is to sit straight. So, we'll test mount it on one adel, and mark out
the second hole using the second adel.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Marking hole location</p><p>Okay, drill it, and then clean up, deburr, round over all the corners, yada yada - the usual drill.</p>
<p>Tadaa!</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Jack likes the bracket very much.</p><p>But we have another transducer. That one's bracket will have to be &quot;mirror image&quot; of the first one.</p>
<p>I used the first bracket to kinda &quot;estimate&quot; the second.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Now, both brackets.</p><p>Are they the same? Hell no. But I wasn't trying to make them the same. Just close enough to do the job.</p>
