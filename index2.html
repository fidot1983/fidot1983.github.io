<hr class="dashed"/><p>Baffle seals on this plane are original reinforced neoprene
rubber, and they were in pretty beat up shape. There is a lot of gaps,
they sag in places, making the seal really not that good.</p>
<p>So one of the things I decided to do is to redo them.</p>
<p>Pardon the cruddy pictures; but those ones are the only ones I have :(</p>
<div class="section" id="the-nosebowl">
<h2>The Nosebowl</h2>
<p>One of the things I noticed immediately is that baffle seals were turned the
wrong way in the nosebowl area; where the front &quot;air ramp&quot; joins the bottom of
the nosebowl.</p>
<p>Here's the nosebowl and the front ramp:</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-05-17-cowling-conundrum/cc1.jpg" title="Front ramp" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-05-17-cowling-conundrum/cc1-thumb.jpg" title="Front ramp" alt="Front ramp" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Front ramp</p><p>Notice the circled area? Here it is, from the back:</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-05-17-cowling-conundrum/cc2.jpg" title="The behinds" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-05-17-cowling-conundrum/cc2-thumb.jpg" title="The behinds" alt="The behinds" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">The behinds</p><p>That marked rubber seal is in the circled area. Notice it's turned the wrong
way; &quot;into&quot; the cowling, rather than away from it? Ram air hitting that
front &quot;ramp&quot; will &quot;bend it in&quot;, and leak into the underside of the engine
compartment - precisely where it's <em>not</em> supposed to go.</p>
<p>Naive me thought that it was just wrongly installed - the rubber needed to have been folded up and out, &quot;into&quot; the lip of the nosebowl.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-05-17-cowling-conundrum/cc3.jpg" title="Correct and current seal orientation" >

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Correct and current seal orientation</p><p>Ha! Well, Remo (the guy who built the Charger) thought different.</p>
<p>There's just not enough <em>room</em> there. Everything is super tight.
The seal just won't go there and <em>stay</em> there. There's just no room.</p>
<p>Look at the above two pictures - inside and outside - again. You'll understand
why. Use pop rivet line as your reference.</p>
<p>Here's where the problem gets worse.
Ramp is really <em>thin</em> - so with just a mild pressure, I can make that gap
between the ramp and the bowl 1/4 - 3/8 inches. Guess what happens when ram
air hits it... :)</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">What ram air does...</p><p>Okay, so then I went digging.</p>
<p>I thought this was a <em>standard</em> bowl.
I was right!</p>
<p>It's an old Comanche single style bowl (I think).</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Changer vs. the Comanche</p><p>This is cross section. Mine's on the left, Comanche's on the right.
Red is nosebowl; blue is this ramp, and black is my baffle seal.</p>
<p>Mine is &quot;concave&quot;. Comanche is &quot;convex&quot;. So if I got my thinking right,
this makes the Comanche version more rigid facing the wind.</p>
<p>Drawing from the Comanche's parts' manual confirms this proper curve.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-05-17-cowling-conundrum/cc8.jpg" title="Comanche parts manual on baffles" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-05-17-cowling-conundrum/cc8-thumb.jpg" title="Comanche parts manual on baffles" alt="Comanche parts manual on baffles" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Comanche parts manual on baffles</p><p>The parts I'm talking about are numbers 11 and 12, bottom right corner.</p>
<p>But how the heck do they seal them? Notice that the material on the drawing
above seemingly  has some &quot;dots&quot; on it (as opposed to the rubber material on
the side baffles).</p>
<p>Well, back to our &quot;remade Comanche front baffles&quot; guy.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Forward baffles from Comanche Gear guy</p><p>Felt strip!</p>
<p>Well, I guess that makes sense. Felt wrapped <em>around</em> the front ramp.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-05-17-cowling-conundrum/cc11.jpg" title="Felt strip" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-05-17-cowling-conundrum/cc11-thumb.jpg" title="Felt strip" alt="Felt strip" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Felt strip</p><p>Felt is thick and, contacting the nosebowl, I guess, will create a good
enough seal if the ramp is rigid enough. I am guessing that Comanche's
ramps are way more rigid than mine due to that opposed curve.</p>
<p>So where are we at with all this?</p>
<p>Remo probably built this noseramp himself. It looks very custom.
It's too thin and doesn't have rigidity - ram air will flex bend it
&quot;into&quot; the cowling. It's not sealed properly practically along all of that
bottom edge between the bowl and the ramp.</p>
<p>The only hope for it is that it's aerodynamic-ish and looks like a
&quot;dozer blade&quot; - curved up. Maybe the nosebowl lip deflects the air enough
for it not to go under too much:</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-05-17-cowling-conundrum/cc12.jpg" title="Airflow diagram" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-05-17-cowling-conundrum/cc12-thumb.jpg" title="Airflow diagram" alt="Airflow diagram" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Airflow diagram</p><p>Can I replace the current rubber seal with felt?</p>
<p>Maybe. The front of the engine moves. The ramp's aluminum is very light - I
am afraid that if I were to add any reasonable quantity of felt to it to hold
the seal tight it will warp the aluminum via relative motion of that ramp
(hooked up to the engine) rubbing on the bottom of the nosebowl.
Or worse yet, make a hole in the bowl.</p>
<p>Can I replace the ramp? Well, everything's possible; but that's a massive
undertaking. That ramp / nose baffle, Comanche-style, has that compound curve,
and I don't have time or skill to do it <em>fast</em>. 2 months? Maybe, if I get lucky.
BTW this is probably <em>why</em> Remo did it this way - because his is just an
aluminum sheet, wrapped around the front of the engine, &quot;neck cone&quot; style, and
cut to fit.</p>
<p>So, what do I do?</p>
<p>After discussing this at length with my good friend Ben, we settled on testing
this out first to see how bad the air flow going &quot;under&quot; will be. I can mark
the bottom of the nosebowl with some tinted oil, and go fly. Oil streaks will
tell me if the air is flowing under a lot, or not so much.</p>
<p>I'll also replace all the other baffle seals, which will improve cooling.
There's a lot of gaps to RTV, too.</p>
<p>I don't want to replace the bottom nosebowl ones, because actually there the
rigidity of old neoprene rubber seals should help...</p>

<p>We got together with John, my IA, and continued working on the plane
early April.</p>
<p>We pulled the prop, so that I will have access to baffles (I wanted to

decided to pull the intakes and replace the gaskets. This is my karma. I did
that on the Cheetah just a year ago, and scraping remnants of one of those
gaskets and re-chasing the threads took me about 10 hours; maybe more.</p>

<hr class="dashed"/><p>Only had a few hours today, so decided to concentrate on taking off the wing root fairings. As I mentioned before, the &quot;back-side accessible&quot;
screws were set up to have nuts on them rather than nutplates. Well, I don't know about that accessibility....</p>
<p>It ended up being 3 hours for ~30 screws.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Root fairing off</p><p>Most of them on the back side of the wing require you reaching with a wrench thru the rear cockpit, and my arm is just barely long enough
to do that successfully. Since nuts are nyloc, no way I can hold them with my fingers - they need a socket.</p>
<p>Some of those nuts are in a U-type channel over which the fabric is glued, and some of the holes are off-center: making it impossible to put a socket over them.</p>
<p>I could've ground a socket down; but I don't have a grinder - so especially one of the nuts took a while to get off. And oh, you have to do
all that without dropping the nut and the washer onto the floor (and having them go into the tail). So the process looked like this:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Get your hand in, try to put the socket over the nut.</li>
<li>While holding the ratchet,  try to put the screwdriver into the screw w/o missing it and poking a hole in the fabric.</li>
<li>Undo the screw, almost.</li>
<li>Remove the socket, take a strong magnet.</li>
<li>Finish undoing the screw, hoping that the magnet will catch the washer and the nut.</li>
</ul>
<p>Having magnetic sockets helped. They weren't deep enough to grab most of the fully tightened nuts because screws protruded from them. I used them as magnets sometimes, and sometimes used my magnetic &quot;fishing for lost hardware&quot; probe.</p>
<p>Now I'm writing this, I realized what I should've been doing is using a long extension and a 90 degree adapter on my socket. Damn! But this still doesn't solve
the problem with some of the nuts that were hidden almost behind things that were in the way (ie, a trim control wheel's attachment structure that's
welded into the fuselage).</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">One of those pesky nuts</p><p>I'm considering replacing those nuts with Tinnerman-type and screws with sheet metal screws thru Tinnermans. I'd put some anti-chafe tape inside the U-channel,
and then Tinnermans on top of it. Since Tinnermans are long, when undoing (or tightening) the screw, they will turn and touch the side of the U-channel, which will act as a wrench.</p>

<h2>Decision</h2>
<p>After <a class="reference external" href="http://79ft.net/entries/2019-03-27-meet-81G/">getting the Charger</a>, I have decided to fix
a few basics.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Clean plugs</li>
<li>Change oil</li>
<li>Give her a good look over</li>
</ul>
<p>Getting a bit ahead of myself, a series of coincidences (airport closed, baffles' condition, intake leak, and others)
made me decide to go thru the annu... sorry, Condition inspection (damn, will have to get used to new nomenclature :) ).</p>

<h2>Notes</h2>
<p>Cowling came off.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-03-30-annual/3-30-1.jpg" title="Cowling off" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-03-30-annual/3-30-1-thumb.jpg" title="Cowling off" alt="Cowling off" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Cowling off</p><p>Discovered a few booboos:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Cracked cowl inlet ramp: need to stop drill.</li>
<li>Baffle seal behind the inlet ramp is turned the wrong way (Glenn was complaining about high temps - one of the reasons, hmm?).</li>
<li>Top baffle seals are too hard and sag in few spots.</li>
<li>One of the air take-offs off the ramp has almost un-riveted itself.</li>
</ul>
<p>Since I will need some helps with skills and tools with riveting, and we'll need to pull the prop to change (and turn the right way) the
seals, decided that I will put her thru annual.</p>
<p>Studying the systems (I was mainly concentrated on fuel and other al lines and hoses to see where things go), discovered a few things, too</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>She has the Rotec TBI-40-MKI TBI installed, which requires a 40 mesh filter <em>upstream</em> of it. The only filter besides finger strainers in tanks is gascolator, which goes down to 72 micron (0.003) only. Need to get a hold of Rotec people and discuss this situation.</li>
<li>The &quot;low&quot; end of the tank (in 3-point attitude) has a very nice drain fitting + drain cock draining behind the cowl. I am seriously considering adding a quick drain there - that <em>is</em> the lowest point of the tank in 3-point. My thinking is: water collected in the tank, goes to that lowest point; but there's not enough of it to go thru the take-off (which is in the middle). Then, when I raise the tail, it slushes forward, goes into the take-off, and reaches the engine right when I am just off the runway. Not Good.</li>
<li>Some un-critical drain hoses are clear vinyl and hard as a rock. For now will replace them with clear polyurethane, and if that hardens, with rubber.</li>
<li>TBI needs positive stops on the throttle quadrant. Need to check if they're present and adjust as necessary.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Fairings</h2>
<p>Spent the rest of the day taking off fairings and access panels. This is the first thing I thing could've been done better here methinks. Everywhere where
it was deemed that the back side would be &quot;accessible&quot;, Remo used #6-32 nyloc AN nuts on machine screws instead of nutplates. Well, some of those nuts
are <em>not</em> accessible, and I gave up on quite a bit of them around the rear wing root fairings.</p>

<h2>Fade In</h2>
<p>I met Glenn and Judi in 2014.</p>
<p>This was my second Oshkosh, and the first time I noticed the Biplane Forum's
Beer'O'Clock thread.</p>
<p>We had two &quot;events&quot; that year: one in the Vintage at the
awesome Piper Pub (yep, the spelling is right - it was a Tri-Pacer with the
baggage door that had a beer tap. The guy who owned it claimed he had an STC;
but paperwork got soaked in beer and was drying somewhere). We sneaked in a large
cooler of Austin sour beer then, hauling it all the way from the opposite end of Camp
Scholler. I met Glenn there, and later that night washed out in his camp and was fed
with a kick-ass grilled cheese sandwich, and met Judi.</p>
<p>The second &quot;event&quot; was at Glenn's airplane, parked near Homebuilder's HQ. It was a beautiful
Marquart Charger, I learned then; a 1987 Golden Lindy recipient, built by Remo Galeazzi in Petaluma, CA.</p>
<p>That biplane was beautiful; just the right curves and not as aggressive as more modern ones like Pitts and Skybolts.
It looked straight from the 1930s, with wooden prop tipping the nose. I fell in love with it.</p>
<p>In 2015, we've had a good crowd around the plane.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-03-27-meet-81G/osh15.jpg" title="Oshkosh 2015 Biplane Forum Beer'o'Clock crowd" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-03-27-meet-81G/osh15-thumb.jpg" title="Oshkosh 2015 Biplane Forum Beer'o'Clock crowd" alt="Oshkosh 2015 Biplane Forum Beer'o'Clock crowd" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Oshkosh 2015 Biplane Forum Beer'o'Clock crowd</p><p>Glenn's Charger became a traditional spot for these beer get-togethers, and we became friends who only met at Oshkosh; but to me
it felt like I knew Glenn for my whole life, and 11.5 months between AirVentures felt like hours.</p>
<p>In 2016, I was finally around Chicago where Glenn lived, and he took me out to his home field, Poplar Grove.
Man, what an airport! Just the right kind for his plane. We spent a day there, and I think I have seen only <em>one</em> spam can
and maybe one RV. The others were a few Cubs, a Twin Beech, a Waco, and the like. A few friends showed up, and that day I got
a ride in an AcroSport bipe, and later in the evening, finally, in the Charger.</p>
<p>Oh man. I flew a couple sport biplanes before; and while I liked them, they were too much for this lazy guy. Just a bit too twitchy and
too sensitive.</p>
<p>This plane? It flew just like a Grumman. Perfect control harmony. Perfect, light forces on both elevator and ailerons. It fit like a glove.</p>
<p>Then, that night, by the way, I started seriously reconsidering building a Skybolt (BTW, this site was started as a Builder's Log for a Skybolt).
I flew one, and while I still liked the plane, I liked the Charger even more.</p>
<p>Especially with it's more &quot;classic&quot; looks (and come on, admit it, we pick biplanes for looks), and it's perfect flyability.</p>
<p>In 2017, we did Beer'o'Clock at my camp (I forget why.. maybe the Charger wasn't around).</p>
<p>And later that year, Glenn told me he's thinking about selling it. He got too much stuff on his hands, and didn't want to neglect the Grand Champion.</p>
<p>I thought for about a day. I loved <a class="reference external" href="http://79ft.net/tag/9891u.html">my Cheetah</a>, and I loved the fact that it was a &quot;normal&quot; airplane. I could take my 2 year old son up
in it. Not in a biplane. I could take &quot;normal&quot; people up in a Cheetah. Not in an open cockpit biplane - at least, it's a bit more.. rough, shall we say?</p>
<p>But I couldn't let the plane I loved just be sold on the Barnstormers; so the next day I told Glenn I'll take care of her when the time comes. I was overwhelmed,
and honored to have a chance of taking care of a piece of aviating and homebuilding history.</p>

<h2>The Plane</h2>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-03-27-meet-81G/beauty.jpg" title="The MA5 Charger" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-03-27-meet-81G/beauty-thumb.jpg" title="The MA5 Charger" alt="The MA5 Charger" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">The MA5 Charger</p><p>She was built in 1982. From what I could gather, she was started in 1977. There were two guys who built two MA5 Chargers in a chickenhouse in Petaluma, CA.
Glenn's plane was built by Remo Galeazzi, and won the Golden Lindy in 1987. The other Charger won too by the way, some years earlier :).</p>
<p>Remo wrote a <a class="reference external" href="/pdfs/chicken-house-chargers.pdf">really nice article for Sport Aviation about both planes</a>.</p>
<p>Here's <a class="reference external" href="/pdfs/remos-charger.pdf">another article about the plane</a>.</p>
<p>Glenn changed it a bit, adding the smoke system, changing the prop to wood, and tweaking the induction and fuel systems. But the plane stayed all original
mostly - original engine, original fabric, and such.</p>
<p>Oh, and it's <em>the</em> Charger <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marquart_MA-5_Charger">on Wikipedia</a> :)!</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="logistics">
<h2>Logistics</h2>
<p>I told Glenn to give me 6 months heads up, so that I could work out the logistics.</p>
<p>See, I have lots of hours to be very comfy flying any common tricycle single. I didn't have enough experience to haul a <em>taildragger bipe</em> across the country
(Glenn moved to CA by then). I would have to learn how to fly it comfortably before embarking on the trip; and figure out the logistics.</p>
<p>But then, things went much faster than I thought.</p>
<p>At Oshkosh 2018, Glenn was telling me he's about to sell the plane. I realized I didn't have time to train enough, and that it would be better to train
in the Charger from the getgo. So the working plan became me renting a large-ish truck, and hauling the airplane over to Texas with wings off.</p>
<p>And then, Glenn offered to fly the plane over himself, as a good bye to her. I couldn't refuse.</p>
<p>September 2018, Glenn told me he's gonna fly the plane over soon. I put the Cheetah up for sale, and
<a class="reference external" href="http://79ft.net/entries/2018-11-21-bye/">said my last goodbyes to her</a> November 21, 2018. Then, life and weather intervened, and we couldn't set the
trip up till last weekend.</p>
<p>'It's warming up', Glenn texted me a week and a half ago.</p>
<p>A week after that text, he was wheels up en route to TX, with Judi in the front hole.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-trip">
<h2>The Trip</h2>
<p>That didn't last long. An hour and change later, Glenn was stuck in Bakersfield, just at the southern tip of Central Valley, CA. All mountain passes
were blocked by low ceilings...</p>
<p>What's funny was that I was flying.. strike that, being flown from San Jose to Los Angeles, continuing to Texas, the same day Glenn and Judi were stuck at Bakersfield. I saw the damn
clouds blocking the passes. They were maybe a mile wide!!!</p>
<p>This delayed them by about 24 hours, but the rest of the trip was fairly smooth. They did a lot of flying after being stuck in Bakersfield for practically a whole day, and
some hours the following day.</p>

<h2>Fin</h2>
<p>It was all so fast, I was in the state of... denial? and disbelief? I started becoming overwhelmed when I got back home in the evening on that day, and opened up the
logbooks.</p>
<p>Remo's signatures and flight log.</p>
<p>Remo's letters.</p>
<p>Glenn's signatures and notes.</p>
<p>The letter from Remo to Glenn, with a bunch of pictures - just pictures of this Charger being built; mundane almost; but a part of the Champion's history.</p>

<hr class="dashed"/><p>Great weather today. A bit cold, but sunny, calm, and overall very promising.</p>
<p>I rolled out the Cheetah out of her hangar for the last time.</p>
<p>This was a weird feeling.</p>
<p>When you have an airplane sitting in the hangar 20 minutes away from your
house, you tend to sometimes put flying off.</p>
<p>It typically goes along these lines.</p>
<p>Hey, it's Saturday coming up. I gotta go bounce around! <em>check the weather</em>
Hmm...looks a bit iffy. Maybe I should do
<em>this-other-thing-around-the-house-shop-or-whatever-I-hadn't-gotten-around-to</em>.
Maybe, I'll go flying after that...</p>
<p>Evening rolls in, you're tired and not up for flying anymore.. Meanwhile,
weather was perfect the whole day!</p>
<p>&quot;Next week&quot;,
you think. And you go out next week, but this time it's something else that
pops up and you have to get to it later in the day, and instead of spending
half a day bouncing around, you buzz around the pattern for half an hour and
go back to your daily messes and stuff to do around the house.</p>
<p>Not every Saturday was like that since I got back to having time to do plane
stuff... but often, it did.</p>
<p>But this time, today. It was weird. The knowing that I am flying <em>her</em> for
the last time, that I am listening to GTU ATIS on <em>her</em> radios for the last
time, the last VOR to be tuned in, last turn direct to the destination, last
approach guy handing you over to your destination's Tower...</p>
<p>&quot;Field in sight&quot;...</p>
<p>On a day like today...</p>
<p>Sunny, silky smooth, a touch of clouds, with all the gauges' needles frozen
in place...</p>
<p>You remember all the good times you had together, and think... I'll miss you,
Cheetah!</p>
<p>I guess, in the Spirit of Thanksgiving..?</p>
<p>Thank you for all the wingovers, low passes over lakes, and river runs.</p>
<p>Thank you for all the kids we've flown as Young Eagles.</p>
<p>Thank you for getting my ass out of that fog along the coast of Madagorda Island (that one was the &quot;bag of luck&quot; to &quot;bag of experience&quot; type thing for sure!)</p>
<p>Thank you for all the <a class="reference external" href="/tag/9891u.html">fun I had messing with you</a>.</p>
<p>Thank you for that unique kind of smell that your inside smelled with (and my tiger LeRoy who lived in the plane still smells like you!)</p>
<p>Thank you for being a good plane and not giving me any trouble.</p>
<p>I hope I'll see you again sometime! And maybe then, we'll go bounce around
together again. Just like the good old times.</p>

<hr class="dashed"/><p><a class="reference external" href="http://79ft.net/entries/pickles/">As we have established before</a>, Fall for Russians is all about pickling things.</p>
<p>Last time it was an O-360. This time, it's tools for the new shop.</p>
<p>My current shop is all packed up and in storage, waiting for the actual
shop to be built. Well, actually for the building to be gutted.</p>
<p>When I have built the new house, I have kept the old house. That's what's
about to become my Dream Shop. Meanwhile, all my tools are nicely set up
in my storage shed, waiting for their time.</p>
<p>I have sold most of my Chinese Grizzly crap I bought before knowing
any better, and was hunting good, old, American-made machines for a while.</p>
<p>Okay, I settled for a Chinese-made Powermatic drill press, arguing with
myself that it was in mint shape, dialed in with no obvious runout / shake,
and would be my wood-only press anyway.</p>
<p>But two most important things wood-wise I still didn't have: a jointer and a
table saw. Few had come up on Craigslist, and I would go over to check them out
with all my dial gauges and a U-Haul trailer in tow.</p>
<p>I would spend close to an hour with each one of them, measuring all sorts of
convoluted alignments and run-outs, only to find something very <em>basic</em> wrong
with them.</p>
<p>One of these was a newer (mustard, but still American-made) PM60 jointer. It
checked out reasonably well; until I asked the guy if I could adjust his fence
square (I wanted to check it's warp by measuring squareness to tables along
it's length).</p>
<p>&quot;Sure Thing!&quot; - he said, walked to a corner of his shop, picked up a hammer,
and ... WHACK! - ... ... yeah. Call me a WHACK-o, but that is <em>not</em> how you
adjust squareness...  Not in my book. I felt for the poor machine.</p>
<p>I left, of course.</p>
<p>Another time I spent just south of 40 minutes with a PM66 table saw, only to check
it's flatness dead last. Of course, it was so horribly bowed out of shape,
I had to leave. And <em>that</em> was a 3 hour drive. Each way, mind you!</p>
<p>At any rate, yet another PM60 jointer popped up on Craigslist, and I grabbed
a trailer in preparation of going to San Antonio the next day. That's where
the jointer was.</p>
<p>Now, there was a rolling joke with one of the guys from the office - that he
absolutely HAS to convince yet another guy from our office, his buddy, to
sell me his PM66 saw - or, Russian Mafia will get him! Them both, in fact!</p>
<p>I kept it up for over a year; and I am not sure if that joke had made any
contribution to this... but, he called me and said, &quot;Roger is selling his
Powermatic! Grab it, QUICK!&quot;. Same day as the jointer popped up.</p>
<p>Hah. So tomorrow I am about to go possibly pick up a jointer.
Did I just land me a saw too?</p>
<p>I went to Roger's to dial the saw.</p>
<p>Arbor was shot, but trunnions were in great shape, and arbor for PM-66 is not
a problem (someone still literally makes them and sells them on EBay). The
tables were flat aside from a very tiny dip, a bit dirty at that, but alright.</p>
<p>I decided to pick it up.</p>
<p>So I did land me a saw and a possible jointer!!!</p>
<p>Next day (Friday), I rush to San Antonio to look at the jointer.</p>
<p>It was a green, older one, and it checked out good, except one minor
mis-alignment of infeed and outfeed tables. I was trying to tighten them up
a touch with gib set screws, and... I broke one of them.</p>
<p>The tables were flat, the motor was good, and the price was reasonable though,
so I decided to buy it from the guy - especially after I broke it :).</p>
<p>Didn't take any pictures of jointer in transit... damn.</p>
<p>So, Friday night Im back, barely manage to roll the jointer off the trailer and into the garage, and Saturday I pack my wrenches and such to go break down the saw at Roger's.</p>
<p>See, it was set up with a large side table, router plate insert, and outfeeds
- no way I would've been able to load all that; and besides,  I don't need
any of that aside from core saw. I already have all my router stuff from
my previous shop (<a class="reference external" href="http://www.incrementaltools.com/">Incra</a> no less).</p>
<p>It's raining. Damn.</p>
<p>I get to his place - he's gone for the weekend, his wife lets me in and leaves
me alone with the saw and my tools.</p>

<hr class="dashed"/><p>After using <a class="reference external" href="http://79ft.net/entries/2014-05-20-b-log/">the setup I did for myself in 2014</a> for a while,  I decided it was time to change things around a bit.</p>
<div class="section" id="segway">
<h2>Segway</h2>
<p><em>... so yeah. I needed to add a static page, and I had a bunch of ideas about
extra stuff I wanted to do for a while. But mostly, I just needed to add a
damn static page, and thinking about coercing the existing setup into
doing that with all the pictures I needed there was not making me happy...</em></p>
<p><em>... it was also about time I set this thing up so that I could actually
log more projects than just a single airplane. Hey, I bet we all
know - websites of this kind are mostly created to be later enjoyed by their
authors in periods of 'I ain't got nothing better to do than review
my old notes' mood ...</em></p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="multiple-projects">
<h2>Multiple Projects</h2>
<p>First of all, I wanted to be able to log multiple projects. The way the old
setup was done was it had basically one project, under the section
called &quot;Build&quot;, and then this dangling catch-all &quot;blog&quot; thing for everything
else.</p>
<p>But as you can see, most of articles here actually are NOT about the airplane
I was working on at the time - the Skybolt - but rather, other little things
here and there.</p>
<p>First thing I did, is I changed the way the files are laid out, and added
semantics converting source content's directory structure to
&quot;Project / Section&quot; semantics.</p>
<p>Each project now has it's own &quot;sub-log&quot; (that's what time logged is tracked
based on). There is still a catch-all &quot;blog&quot; section, and a &quot;default&quot;
project that can be configured if one so desires.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="logging">
<h2>Logging</h2>
<p>One more thing I realised is that the original version would only allow to log
time if it was associated with an article-type entry... Flooding the Internet
with tens of pages of &quot;built three more ribs tonight&quot; type stuff <em>just to log
time</em> seemed kinda silly, so I added support for plain text log entries.</p>
<p>Articles still can track time; but you can also now have a separate text
file with just &quot;Date&quot;, &quot;Summary&quot;, and &quot;Time Logged&quot; entries - one per line.</p>
<p>When creating the &quot;log&quot; page for a project, entries, being both
from articles and from logfiles, are sorted by date,
and then ones with articles associated with them will pick their summaries up
from articles. Entries coming from text files will be displayed with summaries
from log files.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="major-code-cleanup">
<h2>Major Code Cleanup</h2>
<p>All this time tracking functionality, structuring articles into projects, and
such, were becoming  an entity of its own large enough for me to justify
clumping it all into a single Pelican's plugin, now called &quot;b_log&quot;. I also
added a bunch of config options to set up it's behavior.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="no-google-analytics">
<h2>No Google Analytics</h2>
<p>Yeah. I killed it. This site Does Not Track You now. Because there's too
much of this crap online.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="fixes-fixes-fixes">
<h2>Fixes, Fixes, Fixes</h2>
<p>Too many to count...</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Fixed how logos and icons behave</li>
<li>Fixed templates in numerous places</li>
<li>Fixed bugs in image processing and copying</li>
<li>Images in <em>pages</em> now handled properly - they just weren't. At all</li>
<li>Decimals in logged times would sometimes show up to 10 digits past the decimal
point</li>
<li>...</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="silliness">
<h2>Silliness</h2>
<p>And finally, some silliness! I wrote another plugin that adds a &quot;quote of the
day&quot; at the end of each article, randomly :) Enjoy; and I hope they will
encourage you to read more articles (or at least, scroll thru them
to get to the bits of wisdom).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="and-so-v2">
<h2>And So, (v2)</h2>
<p>I got happier now.</p>
<p>I have changed the <a class="reference external" href="http://79ft.net/entries/2014-05-20-b-log/">B-Log notes</a>
to match the new setup, just so that there's one place I can send people
to in case they are interested in my setup.</p>
<p>And I'm very close to posting that damn page, but...</p>
<p><em>...of course, I am restructuring the old content and modifying old pages
instead to match what I got now, and writing stupid notes on what I did to
the thing. Because, as we all know, making yourself a tool is as, if not
more, pleasant, as using it...</em></p>

<hr class="dashed"/><p>In the past 7 months I have been busy building... the crib for the baby. Almost
non stop evenings, 4-6 hours a day: the result is good, but this is a &quot;Skybolt
Story&quot;, not a &quot;Bed Story&quot;: so no, I won't post all my projects here :).</p>
<p>Also, it seems like next 2-3 years will be mostly furniture building for
this guy.. Oh well.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I was able to put in a few hours into fixing up the coves in
my wingtips where all the lights are.</p>
<p>If you recall, I have made <a class="reference external" href="http://79ft.net/entries/cheetah-strobe-shields/">strobe shields</a> quite a while back, but I haven't fixed up the coves. I was waiting for the shields to be painted.</p>
<p>Well, they were during the <a class="reference external" href="http://79ft.net/entries/cgr-30/">cgr-30 install</a>,
and then I was working on the crib.. So finally, the time has come.</p>
<p>Look at what I had to start with.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/cheetah-wingtips-cleanup/wingtips-1.jpg" title="Sad sad wingtip" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/cheetah-wingtips-cleanup/wingtips-1-thumb.jpg" title="Sad sad wingtip" alt="Sad sad wingtip" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Sad sad wingtip</p> <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/cheetah-wingtips-cleanup/wingtips-2.jpg" title="Another sad wingtip" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/cheetah-wingtips-cleanup/wingtips-2-thumb.jpg" title="Another sad wingtip" alt="Another sad wingtip" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Another sad wingtip</p><p>First, all the lights came out. The old plastic lenses went straight into the
trash bin. Then, came off the foam padding that goes in between the lens and the
wingtip.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/cheetah-wingtips-cleanup/wingtips-3.jpg" title="All opened up" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/cheetah-wingtips-cleanup/wingtips-3-thumb.jpg" title="All opened up" alt="All opened up" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">All opened up</p> <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/cheetah-wingtips-cleanup/wingtips-4.jpg" title="Cleaned and sanded" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/cheetah-wingtips-cleanup/wingtips-4-thumb.jpg" title="Cleaned and sanded" alt="Cleaned and sanded" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Cleaned and sanded</p><p>I think the above was about an hour of sanding. All old paint came off. Also,
the broken rivnut went out (did you notice it? That extra hole was what someone
has drilled and used a sheet metal screw to &quot;fix&quot; it instead of drilling out
the broken rivnut).</p>
<p>Finally, masked with the first set of masking tape. I was set to repaint the
coves.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/cheetah-wingtips-cleanup/wingtips-5.jpg" title="Masking the edges" >

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Masking the edges</p><p>The other wingtip was even worse. The cove itself had a huge &quot;dip&quot; in it.
Also, some &quot;genius&quot; decided to screw #10 screws straight into the fiberglass...
Some threads were all torn up, and I decided to install rivnuts all around
to make sure the tips match.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/cheetah-wingtips-cleanup/wingtips-6.jpg" title="Just disassembled, note the large dip in the nav light area" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/cheetah-wingtips-cleanup/wingtips-6-thumb.jpg" title="Just disassembled, note the large dip in the nav light area" alt="Just disassembled, note the large dip in the nav light area" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Just disassembled, note the large dip in the nav light area</p><p>In with Bondo! Lots of sanding! Oh man, I hate sanding...</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/cheetah-wingtips-cleanup/wingtips-7.jpg" title="Bondo, and sanding..." >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/cheetah-wingtips-cleanup/wingtips-7-thumb.jpg" title="Bondo, and sanding..." alt="Bondo, and sanding..." >

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Done sanding</p><p>Phew. Quick fit of the strobe shields over the rivnuts, needed to enlarge the holes...</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/cheetah-wingtips-cleanup/wingtips-9.jpg" title="Fitting holes in the strobe shield" >

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Fitting holes in the strobe shield</p><p>And we're ready with the second one.</p>
<p>Now, I wanted to clean up the nav lights housing as well. Originally I wanted to paint both cover and base, but once I cleaned up the base, I decided to leave it as is: apparently, it was nice and shiny after all that 40 year old corrosion
cleaned off of it!</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/cheetah-wingtips-cleanup/wingtips-10.jpg" title="Nav lights covers. Second one was cleaned up as well" >

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Came out nice after painting!</p><p>Then, final masking, and painting. Damn! That didn't go so well. I didn't
notice a fairly small dip in the other tip's cove, and the Bondo'd one got some
pinholes. Time was running very short so I ended up leaving that as is.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/cheetah-wingtips-cleanup/wingtips-15.jpg" title="Right wingtip cove, painted. See the dip now?" >

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Left tip. That one with pinholes :(</p><p>Once the paint was all dry came the time for fitting the foam padding and
lenses. And here, I made a fatal mistake: I have installed the padding <em>first</em>. That makes fitting of the lens virtually impossible (at least, for me).</p>
<p>That had produced an unsightly gap of about 1/8 inches. Oh god! I had no spare lenses, and I <em>had</em> to put the plane back together not to screw my partner who needed the plane soon. Very soon.</p>
<p>... I ended up screwing him anyway 'cause somewhere in the middle of me fitting
that first lens Max was born and I was knocked out for 5 days ...</p>
<p>... just in case you're wondering: 7lbs 11oz, 20 inches, June 25, 2015, 10:35 am ...</p>
<p>... I still haven't had any chance to get another lens, so I decided to put it back together as is as a memory of me being stupid. Maybe I'll buy another set from Ken in another year or two; and also fix all the dips and pinholes ...</p>
