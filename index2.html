<hr class="dashed"/><p>So most orders have been placed, and a lot of them have arrived already. (Note to self: need to take pictures of all the stuff).</p>
<p>The first thing to be worked on is the heart - the alternator.</p>
<p>Look at this little beauty!</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-08-16-alternator-fitting/a-1.jpg" title="B&C L-40" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-08-16-alternator-fitting/a-1-thumb.jpg" title="B&C L-40" alt="B&C L-40" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">B&C L-40</p><p>Tiny, light as a feather, and cute as a button! No, sir, this thing has to get attached to the nose!</p>
<p>The old one needs to come off. Pivot arm bolt undone. Pivot bold undone.</p>
<p>Wait. The pivot bolt can't get out, because the flywheel gets in the way...</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-08-16-alternator-fitting/a-4.jpg" title="Pivot bolt and interference" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-08-16-alternator-fitting/a-4-thumb.jpg" title="Pivot bolt and interference" alt="Pivot bolt and interference" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Pivot bolt and interference</p><p>Hmm.. No, I can't believe Remo pulled the flywheel off of crank just to install the alternator. There must be a better
way.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-08-16-alternator-fitting/a-6.jpg" title="The better way - bracket attach bolts!" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-08-16-alternator-fitting/a-6-thumb.jpg" title="The better way - bracket attach bolts!" alt="The better way - bracket attach bolts!" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">The better way - bracket attach bolts!</p><p>Aha! This is case mount, and the bracket is attached to the motor case. Let's see... Yep! It came off.</p>
<p>Now, the new bracket... centers nicely!</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-08-16-alternator-fitting/a-8.jpg" title="New bracket" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-08-16-alternator-fitting/a-8-thumb.jpg" title="New bracket" alt="New bracket" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">New bracket</p><p>See that ear on the right, that touches the starter boss? That one needs to attach to the starter, to prevent
the bracket flexing left and right. It lines up great, but, problem number one (but I knew this one), the old
alternator bracket didn't have that. Remo used that hole on the starter boss to hook up the front of the nose &quot;ramp&quot; part of
the baffle:</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-08-16-alternator-fitting/a-2.jpg" title="Baffle attach bracket" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-08-16-alternator-fitting/a-2-thumb.jpg" title="Baffle attach bracket" alt="Baffle attach bracket" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Baffle attach bracket</p><p>No matter. I will just bend up a new one, to account for the thickness of the new bracket's &quot;ear&quot; that will get sandwiched
between this baffle attach bracket, and the starter boss. Material already ordered!</p>
<p>Now, let's test fit the belt, and the new pivot arm. The belt, the belt.. oh wait. Yep. The prop needs to come off - but this
is a non-event now (and I am not leaving the prop off again -
<a class="reference external" href="http://79ft.net/entries/2019-05-17-race-for-the-engine/">learned that one already</a>). I'm becoming quite good at
this prop pulling business....</p>
<p>Belt on and prop back on, test-fitting the pivot arm... CRUD!</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-08-16-alternator-fitting/a-10.jpg" title="Pivot arm" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-08-16-alternator-fitting/a-10-thumb.jpg" title="Pivot arm" alt="Pivot arm" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Pivot arm</p><p>That black bracket to the left of it holds the hose &quot;ramp&quot; portion of the baffle..... and, it won't let the damn pivot
arm go in! No way. And no easy modification here - it's interfering, seriously...</p>
<p>Frankly, at that point I went home (this whole note covers quite a few days of work), with thoughts of remaking the
front baffle; and spent the evening researching how baffles are done on planes with similar nosebowl... Frankly,
I don't like how this front baffle is done on this plane (see
<a class="reference external" href="http://79ft.net/entries/2019-05-17-cowling-conundrum/">Cowling Conundrum</a>), and thought of this as being a good
chance to fix it. I moaned about this to my buddy and colleague Dima D (who's helping me here quite a lot with notes
and advice)...</p>
<p>But next nite, I thought that maybe I can get away with remaking just the arm... I am absolutely not set up to do complicated
sheet metal work at the moment...</p>
<p>The old alternator had this weird pivot arm that now made way more sense. It &quot;doglegged&quot; around the bracket with which
the standard pivot arm interfered:</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-08-16-alternator-fitting/a-11.jpg" title="The old pivot arm" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-08-16-alternator-fitting/a-11-thumb.jpg" title="The old pivot arm" alt="The old pivot arm" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">The old pivot arm</p><p>Notice how it has this portion that goes down, and then the pivot arm &quot;turns&quot; left to go under the nose baffle ramp attach
bracket?</p>
<p>That corner is definitely a large stress riser... but this arm held a much heavier Delco-Remy alternator for almost 40 years...
Granted, it's made out of 0.190 steel as opposed to 0.125 steel used in B&amp;C bracket... but I can make a similar one for
the new alternator...</p>
<p>We'll see if we can smooth out that corner so that it's arcing better, reducing stress. If I can, I will use 0.125 steel.
If I can't, I'll settle with 0.190 - just like the old one. We know this works.</p>
<p>Thanks Dima! You were right. For now. I will redo this nose ramp when I'm redoing the motor, later :).</p>
<p>... and now, to the belt. Let's get this nose ramp back on. It has an opening for the belt to pass thru, and a fairing
for the alternator pulley....</p>
<p>Damn. Yep. That one doesn't fit right, either.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-08-16-alternator-fitting/a-13.jpg" title="Nose ramp back on" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-08-16-alternator-fitting/a-13-thumb.jpg" title="Nose ramp back on" alt="Nose ramp back on" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Nose ramp back on</p><p>If you look real careful inside the red circle, you can just see the belt there. It will rub on the left edge of that hole.
It has to go right, which means the alternator has to go down, which means longer belt.</p>
<p>I used a piece of wire to mock this up. Here are a couple of pictures from the back side.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Wire mocking up a longer belt - so that it's centered in the hole</p><p>I ordered a couple of longer belts from the same series, to try them out and see how they will work in the end...</p>
<p>So, where are we at?</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>I will need a new, smaller, bracket for the front support of that nose baffle ramp (the bracket will attach to the starter, same place as before)</li>
<li>I will need to design and make a new pivot arm - and to learn how to make nice slots with hand tools</li>
<li>A different belt</li>
</ul>
<p>Meanwhile, folks at B&amp;C were extremely helpful and generous with their time, reading my long, ranty, emails, and responding
to me with their thoughts. I really appreciated that!</p>

<hr class="dashed"/><p>So this was quite an effort - not because it was a sophisticated design, but rather because it took quite a bit of time
to lay out in a reasonable fashion...</p>
<p>Oh, and also, somewhere in between I had a break for Oshkosh and a work trip :).</p>
<p>I decided to post this in a form of design notes, so that I can go around asking people what they think...</p>
<div class="section" id="the-new-wiring-diagram">
<h2>The New Wiring Diagram</h2>
<p>I have posted it <a class="reference external" href="/files/6781G-new-electrical/6781G-wiring-diagram.pdf">in PDF over here</a>.</p>
<p>Wire length / drop / load calculations are in the <a class="reference external" href="/files/6781G-new-electrical/6781G-wiring-load-schedule.xlsx">Excel spreadhseet over here</a>.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The design is based on Figure Z-11 from AeroElectric Connection by Bob Nuckolls, with the following tweaks:<ul>
<li>I'm using the B&amp;C LR3C Voltage Regulator, so it's wiring has been incorporated</li>
<li>I dropped the Endurance and Main Battery busses</li>
<li>I have tweaked the starting switches circuit, main buss feeder, and how ammeter is hooked up - see below for discussion</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The diagram is laid out to generally clump the components together as they would be on the airplane. It initially might seem
convoluted - but it has a certain flow to it matching the locations of components. Start in bottom right corner for
battery/starter/alternator circuitry and go counter clockwise - this will effectively take you &quot;thru the airplane&quot; as
the components will be laid out; roughly</li>
</ul>

<div class="section" id="review-items-and-commentary-on-specifics">
<h2>Review Items and Commentary on Specifics</h2>
<div class="section" id="starter-circuitry">
<h3>Starter Circuitry</h3>
<p>My current take on my Starter and Mags circuitry is this:</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-08-11-design-v1/starting-circuit.gif" title="Starting and Mags Circuit" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-08-11-design-v1/starting-circuit.gif" title="Starting and Mags Circuit" alt="Starting and Mags Circuit" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Starting and Mags Circuit</p><p>This is a deviation from Z-11, with both switches having to be in the momentary up position for starter to engage. I like
this better for two reasons:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>It makes the act of starting the motor more explicit</li>
<li>It returns back to correct &quot;running&quot; position automatically</li>
</ul>
<p>I need to test the ergonomics of pressing up a couple switches together. If I don't like it, another alternative would be
to replace the &quot;Right Mag&quot; switch circuitry from -5 to -1: making the top position on it non-momentary (as noted on the diagram).
This will reduce the &quot;user-friendliness&quot; but will still keep the explicitness, especially with my using pull-to-unlock switches
from Honeywell.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="main-power-distribution">
<h3>Main Power Distribution</h3>
<p>The Charging and Buss circuitry excerpt below:</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-08-11-design-v1/power-distribution.gif" title="Power Distribution" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-08-11-design-v1/power-distribution.gif" title="Power Distribution" alt="Power Distribution" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Power Distribution</p><p>Note that:</p>
<p>Shunt is set up to be in the &quot;battery&quot; lead. I like &quot;battery lead&quot; style ammeters, showing charge current on the 12-o-clock-plus
segment, and discharge current on the 12-o-clock-minus segment.</p>
<p>Note that the buss feeder wire is protected by a slow-burn 35A current limiter. In Z-11, that wire is not protected at all. My
reasoning for this decision is that this wire is relatively long on my plane (around 4 feet), since fuse block is near the
rear cockpit. I wanted to protect it.</p>
<p>One area of concern here is that in the event of alternator short, the Ammeter Shunt will be a part of the alternator circuit that
will see a lot of current while the 40A slow burn opens up. My gutfeel says it should be able to handle it, but I am not sure. At
any rate, figure Z-11 has the same setup with shunt on the alternator's B-Lead.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="voltage-regulator-sense-wire">
<h3>Voltage Regulator Sense Wire</h3>
<p>LR3C Voltage Regulator needs a separate &quot;voltage sense&quot; wire that one would normally connect to the main buss. Since the
regulator in my case is closer to the firewall than to the buss (fuse) block, I am connecting it to the main battery
circuitry (jumper wire between Starter and Master contactors). This is somewhat a shorter run and seems that it will be
more logical to measure as close to the battery as possible (especially since I'm saving on wire lengths this way).
Seems sensible to me.</p>
<p>The sense wire will be 20 AWG, about 3' long, and connected via 24 AWG fuselink.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="voltage-regulator-field-supply-circuit">
<h3>Voltage Regulator Field Supply Circuit</h3>
<p>The circuit looks like this:</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-08-11-design-v1/field-supply.gif" title="Field Supply Circuit" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-08-11-design-v1/field-supply.gif" title="Field Supply Circuit" alt="Field Supply Circuit" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Field Supply Circuit</p><p>I copied the AeroElectric's figure Z-11 wire gauges here. In Z-11, everything upstream of Breaker is 18 AWG, and everything
downstream is 20 AWG, but it's not explained why.</p>
<p>Is this driven by a requirement to ensure that fuselink survives the short in the circuit in case of crowbaring, and the
breaker pops first, w/o endangering the fuselink much (18 AWG allows for 22 AWG fuselink instead of 24 AWG)?</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="components-location-and-main-connector">
<h3>Components Location and Main Connector</h3>
<p>Here's a relative diagram of components location, that is necessary for explaining what Main Connector is. Click it for larger
version.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-08-11-design-v1/component-locations.jpg" title="Key component locations" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-08-11-design-v1/component-locations-thumb.jpg" title="Key component locations" alt="Key component locations" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Key component locations</p><p>Note that logically, the way one would wire this airplane would be to pre-wire switches and other items that go into the
pilot's (back) instrument panel with long pigtails, then install the switches, and tie down wiring behind the panel. Then,
the pigtails can be connected to fuse block and loads.</p>
<p>Some of the load wires already exist (lighting for example), and they will have to be spliced to wires coming from switches.</p>
<p>I have decided instead to locate a kind of &quot;Main Connector&quot;  right there near the Fuse
Block. A wire comes off of the Fuse Block, goes to the switch on the panel, then switched power
is returned to the &quot;Main Connector&quot;. Load is on the other side of Main Connector.</p>
<p>This serves a couple purposes:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Create a logical &quot;access point&quot; into the main wire bundle, for reading labels, tracing wires later, and such</li>
<li>Simplify installation process</li>
<li>Connect to existing load wires that are not being replaced</li>
</ul>
<p>For now, I am thinking about using Molex 0.093 pins in two housings (I have 13 circuits total to connect via this thing,
and want to have room for further expansion). I would love suggestions here. One of the requirements is that it should be
easily workable with a multimeter for tracing / testing purposes (I technically could've used  D-Sub here , but am
not due to this precise reason).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="separate-switch-for-turn-and-bank">
<h3>Separate Switch for Turn and Bank</h3>
<p>Yes, it's weird to have that. The original electrical had it. I guess, the logic was to be able to shed half an amp
of unnecessary load in the event of alternator failure, or it was just done for no good reason.</p>
<p>I'm keeping it :).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="front-panel-tach">
<h3>Front Panel Tach</h3>
<p>It's a <a class="reference external" href="http://www.westach.com/instructions/Y2AT3-2.jpg">Westach gauge</a> that feeds off of a magneto P-Lead.
No separate power going to it.</p>
<p>Westach asks for a 1/4 A inline fuse. But why? Seems unnecessary (we don't need to fuse P-Leads).</p>
<p>Wire going to this tach in my opinion need to be shielded P-Lead wire. Not sure if I'm correct here.</p>
<p>I need to tie into one of the P-Leads. I have three options:</p>
<p><strong>At magneto</strong>: I will effectively have two P-Leads coming off of one of them. I have Bendix mags, and connectors on those
might make the whole hookup look ugly. Adds extra wire.</p>
<p><strong>At mag switch in the rear panel</strong>: just adds extra ~4 feet of wire for no reason.</p>
<p><strong>Y-Split the P-lead as it goes along the fuselage</strong>: this seems the most optimal wire-management wise, but I am not sure if
splicing into a P-lead is kosher. I don't see any good reasons why that would be bad, but I don't know everything.
This will likely be a soldered splice unless I find or someone suggests something better. This is my solution of choice at the
moment.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="panel-lighting">
<h3>Panel Lighting</h3>
<p>I am on the fence on this one. On one hand, I can add a nice LED strip light and dimmer to light the panel up.</p>
<p>On the other hand, this is extra weight, and &quot;this is a biplane! you won't fly it at night!&quot; vs. &quot;well what if you find
yourself out late&quot; keeps nagging me. Note: I do <em>not</em> have a landing light (though in a biplane... that's somewhat
a non-necessity ;) ).</p>
<p>I am leaning towards doing it, because doing it now will be easy, and I will have the option to see my gauges at night, even
if that Dark and Stormy Night will be a result of bad planning rather than an intentional thing.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="awg-feeder-for-radios">
<h3>10 AWG Feeder for Radios</h3>
<p>Radio stack was wired via the &quot;Radio Master&quot; switch prior. I was initially going to run separate power feeds to each of the
things in the radio stack, but to get to it, I'll need to pull the wings off (yeah...). It's in between pilot's legs attached
to the bottom of the cockpit.</p>
<p>So, the feeder is staying. The stack has been wired by previous owner recently, and isn't wired badly - with individual fuses
for each radio, and a 10 AWG feeder to it and ground &quot;return&quot; from it.</p>
<p>I'm just putting this &quot;hose&quot; on a 30A fuse, which is more than enough to protect the wire and support all the loads from that
stack.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="strobe-and-nav-on-the-same-circuit">
<h3>Strobe and Nav on the Same Circuit</h3>
<p>I am replacing (TailNav, WingNav) + (old heavy strobe on belly) with <a class="reference external" href="https://uavionix.com/products/skybeacon/">SkyBeacon</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://uavionix.com/products/skysensor/">SkySensor</a> on wingtips and nav/strobe on the tail, but I don't have enough
wiring in the fuselage and wings to have a separate circuit for  strobes. I do not plan to fly IFR (biplane!) so &quot;strobes in
the clouds&quot; is not really an issue. When I will have the rag off the airplane, I will add a separate switching circuit
for just the strobes.</p>

<hr class="dashed"/><p>Well, all the electrical on the Charger is disassembled now. I logged about 24 hours doing it.</p>

<p>But look at the solder joints:</p>

<p>I think I am officially now in the &quot;no soldering on airplanes is an old wife's tale&quot; camp.</p>
<p>At some point, I decided to take a break, and try on the new Voltage Regulator I'm planning on installing.</p>

go somewhere else, too.</p>
<p>By the way, the old voltage regulator in all it's glory:</p>

<hr class="dashed"/><p>Finally, doing some actual work on the airplane, and having fun! And I decided to start logging time.. because, why not!</p>
<div class="section" id="wire-marking">
<h2>Wire Marking</h2>
<p>I like marked wires. I used to be a networking guy, and I was very meticulous about marking every single wire in my cabinets, so that I knew
exactly what was plugged in where.</p>
<p>It took a bit of upfront time, but saved a bunch of it later on.</p>
<p>So naturally, I was planning to do the same on the Charger, and, more importantly, make it look <em>professional</em>.</p>
<p>Thanks to living in this day and age, that is simple. No, I'm not gonna pay someone to laser etch my wires - that's a cop out :). It's like
paying someone to paint your plane.</p>
<p>Instead, I have researched and found a perfect label maker - Brady BMP21 (not including a link here because it will probably go dead after
some time... just search for it). This thing has 3:1 heatshrink tube cartridges.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Shrunk!</p></div>
<div class="section" id="fusible-links">
<h2>Fusible Links</h2>
<p>Every wire must be fused at the source. Well, almost every :). We don't fuse a couple wires like battery - master contactor: but this is
an exception rather than the rule.</p>
<p>Most wires are fused on the fuse block at the main buss. But some wires are impractical or impossible to have hooked up to that. Think ammeter
shunt wires as a classic example.</p>
<p>For those, most people use bulky, ugly, and generally eww-y inline fuses. But there's a better option! Enter fusible links.</p>
<p>The idea is simple: use a short length of wire 4 gauges smaller the wire to be fused. So if your wire to be fused is 20AWG, you would do:</p>
<p>Source -&gt; 24AWG -&gt; 20AWG where the 24AWG segment acts as a fuse. The idea is, in case of a short, that piece will burn first.</p>
<p>So, I wanted to convince myself that that will work fine for me.</p>
<p>Initially, me and my ham neighbor tried to use his ~30 amp power supply to do it. No joy. The best we could do is 22 amps, and (imagine that!) 24
gauge we were trying to burn held up to the abuse with no sweat at all! I could even hold it in my fingers. Yay, milspec wire!</p>
<p>So I decided to go rough. I do have a discarded old  battery, after all. It was time to burn some wires with it.</p>
<p>Here, the red wire is 20AWG, and the black wire is 24AWG. Using crimps for quick setup.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Boom!</p><p>It burnt real quick, in less than a second, and the protected (red) wire barely got hot (I was holding it - that was a part of the test). Yes, say
that I am unscientific all you want - milspec wire holds up to 150C, and I can't hold up to 150C. The 20GA wire got barely warm - which means it
won't cause any problems in a bundle.</p>
<p>It worked!</p>
<p>Now, it was time to set up a real one - to make sure that when the &quot;fuse&quot; wire burns, it doesn't damage anything.</p>
<p>B&amp;C sells very nice fiberglass tubing covered in silicone for exactly this purpose.</p>
<p>I also soldered the fuselink in this time - I wanted to see how well will the solder splices hold to the temps.</p>

sleeve will go over it.</p>

<p>I took it off to inspect.</p>

<p>Great success!</p>
<p>I will need to play with different sizes of heatshrink and probably will use the glue lined strain relief kind just to support everything well, but
hey - this worked very well indeed!</p>

<div class="section" id="load-measurements">
<h2>Load Measurements</h2>
<p>Prior to ripping the old wiring out, I wanted to take some real life load measurements with various things turned on,
so that I don't get any nasty surprises.</p>
<p>But this plane has no ammeter... damn. I searched around, and found this little doodad:</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-06-18-fuselinks/hamm.jpg" title="Hall Effect ammeter" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-06-18-fuselinks/hamm-thumb.jpg" title="Hall Effect ammeter" alt="Hall Effect ammeter" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Hall Effect ammeter</p><p>Very nice. It basically measures current on the wire passing thru this big white ring using Hall effect. Very cool! No need to splice into
the battery leads and install a temp shunt.</p>
<p>So, I rigged it up and took some numbers.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-06-18-fuselinks/amm-1.jpg" title="Rigged up" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-06-18-fuselinks/amm-1-thumb.jpg" title="Rigged up" alt="Rigged up" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Rigged up</p><ul class="simple">
<li>Master On: 1.5 amps<ul>
<li>Includes: Master Solenoid, and a couple of gauges</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Fuel Pump: 0.2 amps</li>
<li>&quot;Radios&quot; switch (turns on engine monitor, and power to radios: turning backlighting on them): 0.8 amps</li>
<li>I-Com Radio, Transmit: 2.6 amps</li>
<li>Intercom: 0.1 amps</li>
<li>Transponder: 1.1 amps</li>
<li>Smoke Oil pump: 2.2 - 2.6 amps (high on startup)</li>
</ul>
<p>So couple interesting things here. I think the x-der number is too low, but it wasn't being interrogated, and I can't make it be interrogated
without flying the plane or using a transponder tester which I don't have. Also, Master On is too high seemingly...
Will need to double check later and isolate things (master solenoid, hobbs, voltmeter, voltage regulator, fuel gauge) if I care enough - I don't
think I do. Also, fuel pump is too low seemingly. Need to double-check the spec.</p>
<p>And then, I could not turn on the Turn-Slip Indicator...</p>

<p>Sad, sad indicator... see, it's <em>long</em>. And it's wire connector is sticking out. And it's right behind the front seat's headrest, and there's
just not enough room for it, and the connector.</p>
<p>So whomever put it in... did this:</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Sad, sad wiring</p><p>It's hard to see; but basically, those wires are bent &quot;down&quot; at a very sharp 90 degrees angle. Notice how he just used pins without the
actual connector. The distance between them is tiny! I am surprised they haven't shorted over all these years. I really am.</p>
<p>Initially, I thought the gauge didn't turn on because that wiring was all bust up, so to test it, I decided to pull it out.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">On the bench</p><p>I cut off the wires with those pins on them to hook it up to my testing battery... hmm.. but I needed some leads! Well, I was gonna
make a bunch of various test leads - so this is as good a time as any! Man, I love soldering...</p>
<p>I long decided to make a bunch of leads with &quot;passthru&quot; banana plugs on one end, and something (a crocodile clamp, a battery clamp,
a ring terminal) on the other. This way, I could mix and match, and plug them into my multimeter; daisy chain, and have multiples
depending on what and how I needed to hook up. I had all the bits (clamps, crocodiles, banana plugs), and even got a roll of very nice super
flexible silicone coated probe wire.</p>

<p>But I had resistance between + and -. And I had voltage! Hmmm..</p>
<p>Second time I hooked it up, I saw a bit of a spark when I put the positive clamp to the battery, and heard something.</p>
<p>I spun the gyro with my finger.... it spun up!</p>
<p>Well, well. So that gyro &quot;froze&quot; in a bit... Yep, it was hard to turn over with a finger - no doubt a small motor in there had a hard time!</p>
<p>I probably &quot;cleared it up&quot; a bit when turning it over with my fingers - but that won't last long... damn.</p>
<p>Are we looking at the overhaul for this thing too now? Sigh.... Maybe I can find parts
to do that myself, but not so sure about that.... It's not common for owners to overhaul their instruments - they're precision clockwork, after
all...</p>
<p>Oh well.</p>
<p>And I will have to figure out how to solve that wiring problem with no space to hook up the right type connector. I am thinking along the
lines of maybe routing a wire from inside of the gauge down thru a hole I'd drill, a grommet it it, and covering the whole business with
with some sealant or something, so that the dust doesn't get in. we'll see. Need to ponder this a bit more.</p>

<hr class="dashed"/><p>Well, since it seems now that my Hangar will become my shop for a while with me doing the
<a class="reference external" href="http://79ft.net/entries/2019-05-16-fire-hazard/">electrical rebuild</a> on the Charger,
I decided to set myself up in it. I am still rebuilding the main shop at the house (reminder: need to write up a couple notes on that),
so the only place I have to work on the plane is in the hangar - and frankly, I probably wouldn't have dragged the whole thing over
to the house anyway just for an electrical rebuild... though it is getting hot, and being in a tin can of a hangar when it's 100 degrees outside
is not.. pleasant, shall we say.</p>
<p>At any rate, the Hangar is now to be officially known as The Dream Shop, Georgetown Annex!</p>
<p>Not much to tell - but much to show here.</p>
<div class="section" id="easy-route">
<h2>Easy Route</h2>
<p>I didn't have anything in the hangar besides a couple of old bookshelves, a couple of small tables, a few filing cabinets I have inherited from my
good friend Pete, and a cart. Not very nicely set up for working on airplanes, and everything was overflowing with parts, tools,
and hardware even after just a bit of disassembly I have done for the annual.</p>
<p>I needed a lot of shelf space, and a lot of bench space.</p>
<p>I decided to take an easy route this time, and instead of building everything, just bought a bunch of shelves at Costco, and benches
and a tool cart at ... Harbor Freight. Yep, I know. Throw a rotten egg in my face next time you see me.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-06-17-hangar-redo/hr-1-2.jpg" title="The First Shelf" >

 </a> <p class="small text-center">The First Shelf</p></div>
<div class="section" id="the-light">
<h2>The Light</h2>
<p>I work evenings a lot, and the only light source there was there was a four T8 tube fixture in the back of the hangar.
But the most interesting stuff is on the front of it (engine, yep :) ). So I added some lights around the front.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-06-17-hangar-redo/hr-2.jpg" title="Lights" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-06-17-hangar-redo/hr-2-thumb.jpg" title="Lights" alt="Lights" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Lights</p></div>
<div class="section" id="the-benches">
<h2>The Benches</h2>
<p>Next, came the benches from Harbor Freight. Don't buy them. They're built like crap, and, frankly, I think I could've built better ones out of
2x4s in about the same amount of time it took me to put these together... But hey, I already bought them, and disassembling the first one
(I got three total) rather than putting the other two together... I didn't want to...</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-06-17-hangar-redo/hr-3.jpg" title="Benches" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-06-17-hangar-redo/hr-3-thumb.jpg" title="Benches" alt="Benches" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Benches</p><p>You might notice the pegboard at the back &quot;wall&quot; of those benches. Well, they attach it every about 12 inches around the perimeter with machine
screws and nuts. Guess what happened to the first pegboard after a humidity cycled high, and then low? Yep; it all warped!</p>
<p>Ended up resorting to straightening it out with shelves that acted as &quot;stiffeners&quot;,  and putting the warped pegboard bench as far
away from the &quot;main&quot; bench as possible).</p>
<p>On the other two I actually made the pegboard &quot;floating&quot; - re-drilled the mounting holes to be large, and used large washers and just enough
small washers underneath to MacGyver me a &quot;bushing&quot;. That worked, and the other two benches' pegboard is straight after quite a few large
humidity changes now.</p>
<p>And then, the sink.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-sink">
<h2>The Sink</h2>
<p>I long had a large 7 gallon jug with a tap. When I was doing a lot of work, I'd drag it out of the hangar, put it on a small folding table, and
use it to wash my hands. Very nice to be able to do that when your hands are covered in oil and crud, and you need to climb into the airplane
or grab something generally clean. I also like clean hands when doing detail work like soldering, painting, etc.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-06-17-hangar-redo/hr-4.jpg" title="The Jug" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-06-17-hangar-redo/hr-4-thumb.jpg" title="The Jug" alt="The Jug" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">The Jug</p><p>But dragging out a 7 gallon jug every time I got into the hangar got very old very fast, and I ended up typically resorting to rags and not
so clean hands, or &quot;washing&quot; them with mineral spirits... ugh.</p>
<p>But hey, we're cleaning up! So I decided to put in...</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-06-17-hangar-redo/hr-5.jpg" title="The Sink!" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-06-17-hangar-redo/hr-5-thumb.jpg" title="The Sink!" alt="The Sink!" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">The Sink!</p><p>But a sink needs a drain!</p>
<p>No problem.</p>

   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-06-17-hangar-redo/hr-6-thumb.jpg" title="The Drain." alt="The Drain." >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">The Drain.</p><p>This came out very nice, and I love that I can now just wash my hands whenever, no jug dragging required.</p>
<p>The best part? The hangar door slides, so I can have it <em>closed</em> and then slide it a bit past it's &quot;closed&quot; position, so that there's a gap
between the hangar divider wall and the outside for the drain to be put out.</p>
<p>But how do I close the door?</p>

</div>
<div class="section" id="the-wiring">
<h2>The Wiring</h2>
<p><em>Before you wire your plane, wire your hangar</em>, says a proverb. Or something like that.</p>
<p>Well, my hangar floods. And it's not <em>my</em> hangar, so I can't quite make holes in the walls and run wiring and conduit. And I only have one outlet.
Yep.</p>
<p>So it was all to be a bunch of extension cords, making sure that all connections are suspended a few inches above the floor, hooked to
something (previous tenant of my hangar had some holes in the walls drilled, so I reused his, or hooked them up to legs of whatever was there, etc).</p>
<p>I ended up making a bunch of splices on extension cords. Hey, I love soldering!</p>

<div class="section" id="air-and-shelves">
<h2>Air and Shelves</h2>
<p>I had a compressor. I moved it to the back corner of the hanger, and hooked up a reel in the front, so that I can have my hoses neat...
Not much more.</p>
<p>The back wall of the hangar got lined with the big shelves, too... Mostly, to stack the parts I take off the plane and need to keep off.</p>
<p>The first one up is there on the right, near the yellow barrel.</p>

<h2>The Shrine</h2>
<p>... and since the Charger is a Grand Champion, I needed a shrine in the &quot;mancave corner&quot; of the hangar. Every hangar must have a
corner with a couch, a fridge and what-not, to relax and ponder and procrastinate. And that's where all the artifacts need to go.</p>

</div>
<div class="section" id="the-bench">
<h2>The Bench</h2>
<p>I needed at least one good bench for grinders, bandsaw, and aluminum work; and there was a perfect spot for it. Didn't have my wood tools
though, so had to use 2x4s straight out of the store... Normally, I mill them down :).</p>

<hr class="dashed"/><p>So after <a class="reference external" href="http://79ft.net/entries/2019-05-16-fire-hazard/">having discovered the electrical mess</a>, I realized that she's gonna be sitting
for a while.</p>
<p>Which meant...</p>
<p>Pickle time! Damn, this pickling thing is becoming a thing, excuse my tautologies...</p>
<p>I had to put her together enough to be able to run the engine to circulate and
warm up pickling oil.</p>
<p>And she was apart. With intakes off, TBI almost off, no oil, and such.</p>
<div class="section" id="fuel-intakes">
<h2>Fuel / Intakes</h2>
<p>So first, it was to be intakes.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-05-17-race-for-the-engine/p-2.jpg" title="RTV where there should be none" >

 </a> <p class="small text-center">RTV where there should be none</p><p>Somebody put RTV to &quot;seal&quot; the intake gasket. Oh well.</p>
<p>Did you know that those 1 1/2 inch rubber hoses that go on intake tubes
are much easier with very thin coat of oil?</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-05-17-race-for-the-engine/p-5.jpg" title="Oiling the hoses" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-05-17-race-for-the-engine/p-5-thumb.jpg" title="Oiling the hoses" alt="Oiling the hoses" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Oiling the hoses</p><p>And then, it was the TBI.</p>
<p>Recall that when I was <a class="reference external" href="http://79ft.net/entries/2019-05-17-annual/">putting her apart</a>, I found pipe dope on the TBI inlet port?</p>
<p>Let me explain.</p>
<p>Fuel goes into gascolator. Then it branches: one branch goes to the engine driven pump, the other goes to the electric pump. Then, they go to the regulator on the TBI. Then, a couple of 90 degree fittings feed it into the TBI's inlet port, which has the &quot;last chance&quot; screen in it.</p>
<p>That's the port here, right above the airflow straightener:</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-05-17-race-for-the-engine/p-1.jpg" title="TBI from the down low" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-05-17-race-for-the-engine/p-1-thumb.jpg" title="TBI from the down low" alt="TBI from the down low" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">TBI from the down low</p><p>See that white gunk? That's Teflon dope. &quot;Aircraft grade&quot;; whatever.</p>
<p>Here's the problem.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-05-17-race-for-the-engine/p-4.jpg" title="TBI inlet hole" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-05-17-race-for-the-engine/p-4-thumb.jpg" title="TBI inlet hole" alt="TBI inlet hole" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">TBI inlet hole</p><p>Fuel has to go there, into that inlet hole. That's what the screen fitting screws into. Right past that, inside the TBI itself, there's a turn, another turn, and
a spray bar that sprays gas into the intake, injection-style, thru a tube
with a bunch of tiny holes. That's why there are screens in the fuel system:
to prevent gunk from clogging up those tiny holes.</p>
<p>So now, what happens when you take a <em>male</em> fitting out of a <em>female</em> threaded hole, and the fitting was doped? Some of that stuff ends up on the female portion. Next time the fitting is put in, dope remnants will be pushed in past the engaged threads, and possibly clog up the works.</p>
<p>Not. Good. At. All.</p>
<p>That's why there is the copper crush gasket behind that screen fitting - to seal it to the TBI body w/o requiring anything extra. You can kinda see that gasket all
smudged around with that dope on the first picture.</p>
<p>So I had to deal with it.. Clean it out somehow.</p>
<p>It was crumbly, but sticky enough to not want to come out.</p>
<p>I tried every solvent on hand. Nope.</p>
<p>I tried carefully scraping it out with a dental probe. Yeah, kinda worked,
but I wasn't satisfied.</p>
<p>I tried every solvent in my buddy Dick's hangar. Nope.</p>
<p>In desperation, I drove to the local Home.. strike that, Aerospace, Depot, thinking
about picking up every kind of solvent they had and I didn't.</p>
<p>And then, I remembered this:</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-05-17-race-for-the-engine/p-3.jpg" title="Goof-OFF!" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-05-17-race-for-the-engine/p-3-thumb.jpg" title="Goof-OFF!" alt="Goof-OFF!" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Goof-OFF!</p><p>I don't know what kind of concoction that is; but it worked! The hole was clean.
Next time was a couple days after, and when I got back to the hangar, I discovered that it has turned into a lake :(</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-05-17-race-for-the-engine/p-7.jpg" title="Lake in my hangar" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-05-17-race-for-the-engine/p-7-thumb.jpg" title="Lake in my hangar" alt="Lake in my hangar" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Lake in my hangar</p><p>Grading's all screwed up around our hangars, and when we get lots and lots of
rain, they flood. Not too much though, luckily. This was the second time in
the past few weeks - first time, I had my tools scattered around the floor.
This time, I was smarter...</p>
<p>Anyway, back to the TBI. The rest of it went together quite nicely. I discovered
that there was TorqueSeal put on the idle mixture screw.</p>
<p>Why? No idea. That screw is spring loaded. Should stay put.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-05-17-race-for-the-engine/p-6.jpg" title="Torque Seal where there should be none" >

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Torque Seal where there should be none</p><p>I wanted to flush the lines and then the TBI to make absolutely sure
none of that dope went it. The best way to do that would be with the electrical
pump; but I'm a one man show.... and the switch for it is 5 feet away from the
firewall.</p>
<p>So, I had to rig me up a little doodad.</p>

when the button was clicked on, the Solenoid would close.</p>
<p>The pump was turned on.</p>
<p>This way, I could click my button, Master Solenoid would close, and the pump
would start running. Neat-o! I'll need it later, too.</p>

<h2>The Pickling</h2>
<p>I borescoped the engine (looked alright - I'll post a report about this later,
maybe...); and it was time to fill'er up with oil.</p>
<p>Pickling oil was mixed up next, and into the engine it went.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">A recipe for a mess...</p><p>After filling the sump up, it was time to check for oil pressure. Lycoming
tells you in SB1241C  to pre-oil your engine by cranking with the starter in
10-30 second bursts until oil pressure comes up to 20 PSI.</p>
<p>Well, oil pressure gauge on the Charger is finicky, so I wanted it to at least
move.</p>
<p>Oh wait. She has an ignition/start switch. No way I can use that to crank and
not have a hot mag w/o messing with P-Leads.</p>
<p>Crap.</p>
<p>Also, I might want to crank from around the firewall (the prop was still off).</p>
<p>But I had my pushbutton doodad!</p>
<p>So I rigged it up to the starter solenoid this time.</p>
<p>Of course I misunderstood the way the starter solenoid was wired.</p>
<p>It had two terminals.</p>
<p>I thought one of them was ground; with the wire going to the firewall.
The other then was supposed to be positive.</p>
<p>That didn't work.</p>
<p>I measured it - between those terminals - nothing. &quot;Dead starter solenoid&quot;,
I though. Crap! It was 8pm. Auto parts stores were closing soon.</p>
<p>I rushed to a nearby O'Reilly. Picked up a starter solenoid. Went back.</p>
<p>Measured it too. NOTHING? How come? Something was amiss.</p>
<p>Only then I started suspecting that something was off. That other terminal on
the original starter solenoid I was hooking my positive wire to was all
corroded and looked like it never had a nut.</p>
<p>OH! The way it's supposed to be wired is that positive goes to the <em>same</em>
terminal where that wire I thought to have been ground was. It wasn't a
ground wire - it was a <em>diode</em>. And the ground was off of the case of the
solenoid.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So, we're cranking now.</p>
<p>30 seconds. No pressure.
30 more. No pressure. Crap!</p>
<p>I unhooked the oil pressure sending hose (the one that hooks up to the line
that goes to the gauge).</p>
<p>Crank. No oil. A couple bubbles is all I got.</p>
<p>CRAP!</p>
<p>The oil pump de-primed itself?</p>
<p>Kinda makes sense I guess? The plane was sitting for way too long :(</p>
<p>So, I took off the oil cooler return line. Dumped another quart of oil in there.</p>
<p>I had this hose fitting that goes on top of an oil bottle that was very neatly
set up to mate with the engine oil hose's flare: so I could squeeze the bottle and push the oil in.</p>
<p>After the whole quart, I re-hooked the line back onto the oil cooler, and tried
again.</p>
<p>Success! Now, I saw oil coming out of the oil pressure sending hose.</p>
<p>Hooked it up to the gauge line, and saw the gauge move, finally. Good.</p>
<p>Damn, with all that cranking I ran out my old battery I had put in there.</p>
<p>Now, have to flip the battery (to put in the good one - the flying one - I always use my old battery from the Cheetah when I mess with electrical, not to abuse the actual &quot;production&quot; battery).</p>
<p>Now, the top spark plugs go back in, the ignition wires get hooked up.</p>
<p>Prop time!</p>
<p>Bolt one - start it in.
Bolt two.
Bolt three.</p>
<p>Bolt 4. Doesn't go in? Not even a chance? What the hell?</p>
<p>I pulled the prop back off and laid it down. Put the front crush plate on top
(that one positions the bolts).</p>
<p>No matter what I did, there'd be at least 3 out of 6 bolts that won't go in.
This time, it was a few dry days, and I guess the prop moved enough to
have the &quot;top&quot; and &quot;bottom&quot; holes (if looking at the prop horizontally) move
closer together. It was off by almost a 1/16th.</p>
<p>So here I was. With an engine that was cranked for a total of a few minutes,
and probably had scraped a lot of oil off of cam lobes and lifters.</p>
<p>With a prop.</p>
<p>I couldn't put on.</p>
<p>Which I needed.</p>
<p>To fire the damn thing up.</p>
<p>It was late. I tidied up, and went home.</p>

<div class="section" id="the-prop">
<h2>The Prop</h2>
<p>I wrote a note to Frank Johnson who made the prop that same night, and called him the next day.</p>
<p>He wasn't surprised. &quot;Redrill&quot; is a simple fix.</p>
<p>But I was a bit apprehensive, and this was a nice excuse to meet him. He's
2 hours away from me. We agreed to meet in a few days, at the first time
he was available.</p>
<p>So, the engine with oil scraped off the lobes had to sit for another couple
days.</p>
<p>Nothing I could do in that short a time...</p>

<hr class="dashed"/><p>This thing nagged me for a while. The Charger did not have the Field breaker.
For that matter, it didn't have the Alternator master breaker, either.</p>
<p>It had this weird &quot;main buss&quot; breaker for 60 amps, but that didn't look
like the Alternator breaker to me.</p>
<p>So in between dealing with other things after having decided to
put her thru <a class="reference external" href="/category/chickenhouse-charger2019-annual.html">Annual in 2019</a>
a bit early, I was running around with my multimeter, tracing wires.</p>
<p>Initially, I quickly discovered that some lines were definitely not fused;
like Battery -&gt; Main Buss line, and thought I'd put inline fuses
into them, and be done.</p>
<p>She has an old charging system; a <em>mechanical</em> switching voltage regulator, and
a Delco Remy alternator seemingly from a tractor:</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-05-16-fire-hazard/fh-1.jpg" title="The old Delco-Remy" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-05-16-fire-hazard/fh-1-thumb.jpg" title="The old Delco-Remy" alt="The old Delco-Remy" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">The old Delco-Remy</p><p>Voltage regulator didn't make sense. It had 4 wires (should be 2: supply and
field output, or 3: supply, sense, and field output).</p>
<p>Alternator didn't make sense. Instead of 1 wire for Field input, it had
two wires.</p>
<p>Additionally, Battery Contactor didn't make sense. One terminal had a wire
going to it. The other was grounded....</p>
<div class="section" id="interlude">
<h2>Interlude</h2>
<p>Battery Contactor is an interesting point here. Normally, one terminal
is connected to the &quot;always hot&quot; side of it (basically, directly to the battery)
and the other goes to the Master Switch. Master Switch turns the Battery
Contactor on by grounding that wire, providing the negative side to the circuit.
It's a safety thing. If that wire breaks, it'll either turn the electrical off
(open circuit), or it will keep it turned on (short to ground). That's it.</p>
<p>But, one of the terminals on the Battery Contactor was grounded... that means,
that the other terminal (the wire coming from the Master Switch) must provide
positive side??? Huh? But where does it get it's power <em>from</em>?</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="tracing">
<h2>Tracing</h2>
<p>So to tracing we went. I spend maybe 10 hours trying to find diagrams
and understand that alternator and voltage regulator hookups.</p>
<p>And me tracing it spelled my doom.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-diagram">
<h2>The Diagram</h2>
<p>Now, I didn't trace the rest of it. Just the main distribution system. That was
enough.</p>
<p>Shall we?</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">The current  main power system of the Charger</p><p>Yep, the diagram is missing the main power buss. It's dangling off of the
same spot where everything else that's interesting is - the
Battery Contactor (marked MA RELAY) &lt;-&gt; Starter Contactor (marked STARTER REL)
link.</p>
<p>So let's see what we have here.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Lots of unfused wires. Do you see a <em>single</em> fuse here? Nope. That's because there aren't any. All the fuses are further downstream, off of the main buss.</li>
<li>Voltage Regulator has this extra wire running to / from cockpit that isn't really necessary and could've been kept on the hot side of the firewall (terminal 4 wire)</li>
<li>Alternator field broken at <em>output</em> (F-&gt;ALT) rather than at <em>input</em> (battery -&gt; terminal 3)</li>
<li>And the best part? <strong>Always hot wire that you can't turn off</strong> between the battery and the Master Switch to turn the Master Solenoid on.</li>
</ul>
<p>That last bit bugged me. I couldn't <em>find</em> the damn thing. Even before
actually tracing it, I knew that if the Master Solenoid is switched on the &quot;hot&quot;
side, it needs to get the power from somewhere, and that only could be battery. But I didn't see <em>any</em> wires on the always hot side of the Master Solenoid.
Only when I traced it, I actually traced the physical wire to where it goes, and
then found it. It was so tucked behind the battery -&gt; Master Solenoid wire that
it was invisible:</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">This little !@#!S@#....</p><p>Oh; and by the way, the Master Switch is the only switch that's <em>soldered</em> in,
and w/o any good insulation around the terminals, and over-stripped wires.
So that's just waiting to short, and the magic smoke that'll be let out
behind the panel when that shorts can't be stopped (always hot wire, remember?)</p>

<div class="section" id="the-wires">
<h2>The Wires</h2>
<p>So I kinda went backwards here; but I thought it'd be easier to see the
diagram first.</p>
<p>Let's see.</p>
<p>Most of connections are made on this very nicely marked terminal block:</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-05-16-fire-hazard/fh-4.jpg" title="The terminal block" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-05-16-fire-hazard/fh-4-thumb.jpg" title="The terminal block" alt="The terminal block" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">The terminal block</p><p>All the switched power comes out there, and every wire is marked. This
actually helped a lot in tracing. This block is on the side of the plane,
right next to the front hole's backrest.</p>
<p>You know what threw me off the most with that damned always hot wire
(I ended up tracing it <em>physically</em>)? It's how it's hooked up.</p>
<p>Yep, it is hooked up to that terminal block. To the terminal... that is
marked.. (drumroll).... &quot;Master Switch&quot;.</p>
<p>Wait.. this actually makes sense... But where's the &quot;return&quot; from the switch?</p>
<p>Ah! It's the wire that's marked.... drumroll... &quot;Fuel Gauge&quot;!</p>
<p>So really, let's look at what's going on, shall we? Zoom in the image below, it's annotated.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-05-16-fire-hazard/fh-explained.jpg" title="Untangled" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-05-16-fire-hazard/fh-explained-thumb.jpg" title="Untangled" alt="Untangled" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Untangled</p><p>So let's see. We've got this bundle of wires, a lot of which are not fused,
and one of which is always hot.</p>
<p>The Main Buss wire is the thickest one (10 gauge maybe?) that's not fused
between this buss bar and the source (engine compartment).</p>
<p>Oh, did I mention that this buss bar is on the side of the plane near the
rear instrument panel (so that 10 gauge run, and the rest of the harness
between firewall and the panel is about 30 inches long)?</p>
<p>What else do we see there? Oh! The two little 1/16inch thick aluminum lines
carrying.. fuel pressure (and oil pressure).</p>
<p>Shall I say more?</p>
<p>Shall I say that there's a fuel tank in between the front hole (passenger) and
the firewall?</p>
<p>That the wires run along between firewall and rear cockpit along that fuel
pressure line (to fuel pressure gauge)?</p>
<p>That if one shorts to this very nearby fuel pressure line, it'll burn a hole
straight thru it, and then ignite the gas that'll start coming out?</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>Can I fix all of that?</p>
<p>Sure. But rewiring will be much much easier, because I have to touch pretty much
everything. Re-running half of individual wires in a bundle is much harder than
re-running them all.</p>
<p>So, I made a decision to rewire the plane... Sigh. Looks like I won't be
flying for a looooong time.</p>
<p>Oh, and tell you what. Tracing wires on a biplane is dangerous. I ended up twisting my knee and pulling a muscle while trying to get behind the panel so badly that I couldn't walk (or sit) for 2.5 days :(.</p>

<hr class="dashed"/><p>Baffle seals on this plane are original reinforced neoprene
rubber, and they were in pretty beat up shape. There is a lot of gaps,
they sag in places, making the seal really not that good.</p>
<p>So one of the things I decided to do is to redo them.</p>
<p>Pardon the cruddy pictures; but those ones are the only ones I have :(</p>
<div class="section" id="the-nosebowl">
<h2>The Nosebowl</h2>
<p>One of the things I noticed immediately is that baffle seals were turned the
wrong way in the nosebowl area; where the front &quot;air ramp&quot; joins the bottom of
the nosebowl.</p>
<p>Here's the nosebowl and the front ramp:</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-05-17-cowling-conundrum/cc1.jpg" title="Front ramp" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-05-17-cowling-conundrum/cc1-thumb.jpg" title="Front ramp" alt="Front ramp" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Front ramp</p><p>Notice the circled area? Here it is, from the back:</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-05-17-cowling-conundrum/cc2.jpg" title="The behinds" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-05-17-cowling-conundrum/cc2-thumb.jpg" title="The behinds" alt="The behinds" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">The behinds</p><p>That marked rubber seal is in the circled area. Notice it's turned the wrong
way; &quot;into&quot; the cowling, rather than away from it? Ram air hitting that
front &quot;ramp&quot; will &quot;bend it in&quot;, and leak into the underside of the engine
compartment - precisely where it's <em>not</em> supposed to go.</p>
<p>Naive me thought that it was just wrongly installed - the rubber needed to have been folded up and out, &quot;into&quot; the lip of the nosebowl.</p>

   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-05-17-cowling-conundrum/cc3-thumb.jpg" title="Correct and current seal orientation" alt="Correct and current seal orientation" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Correct and current seal orientation</p><p>Ha! Well, Remo (the guy who built the Charger) thought different.</p>
<p>There's just not enough <em>room</em> there. Everything is super tight.
The seal just won't go there and <em>stay</em> there. There's just no room.</p>
<p>Look at the above two pictures - inside and outside - again. You'll understand
why. Use pop rivet line as your reference.</p>
<p>Here's where the problem gets worse.
Ramp is really <em>thin</em> - so with just a mild pressure, I can make that gap
between the ramp and the bowl 1/4 - 3/8 inches. Guess what happens when ram
air hits it... :)</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">What ram air does...</p><p>Okay, so then I went digging.</p>
<p>I thought this was a <em>standard</em> bowl.
I was right!</p>
<p>It's an old Comanche single style bowl (I think).</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Changer vs. the Comanche</p><p>This is cross section. Mine's on the left, Comanche's on the right.
Red is nosebowl; blue is this ramp, and black is my baffle seal.</p>
<p>Mine is &quot;concave&quot;. Comanche is &quot;convex&quot;. So if I got my thinking right,
this makes the Comanche version more rigid facing the wind.</p>
<p>Drawing from the Comanche's parts' manual confirms this proper curve.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Comanche parts manual on baffles</p><p>The parts I'm talking about are numbers 11 and 12, bottom right corner.</p>
<p>But how the heck do they seal them? Notice that the material on the drawing
above seemingly  has some &quot;dots&quot; on it (as opposed to the rubber material on
the side baffles).</p>
<p>Well, back to our &quot;remade Comanche front baffles&quot; guy.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Forward baffles from Comanche Gear guy</p><p>Felt strip!</p>
<p>Well, I guess that makes sense. Felt wrapped <em>around</em> the front ramp.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-05-17-cowling-conundrum/cc11.jpg" title="Felt strip" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-05-17-cowling-conundrum/cc11-thumb.jpg" title="Felt strip" alt="Felt strip" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Felt strip</p><p>Felt is thick and, contacting the nosebowl, I guess, will create a good
enough seal if the ramp is rigid enough. I am guessing that Comanche's
ramps are way more rigid than mine due to that opposed curve.</p>
<p>So where are we at with all this?</p>
<p>Remo probably built this noseramp himself. It looks very custom.
It's too thin and doesn't have rigidity - ram air will flex bend it
&quot;into&quot; the cowling. It's not sealed properly practically along all of that
bottom edge between the bowl and the ramp.</p>
<p>The only hope for it is that it's aerodynamic-ish and looks like a
&quot;dozer blade&quot; - curved up. Maybe the nosebowl lip deflects the air enough
for it not to go under too much:</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-05-17-cowling-conundrum/cc12.jpg" title="Airflow diagram" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-05-17-cowling-conundrum/cc12-thumb.jpg" title="Airflow diagram" alt="Airflow diagram" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Airflow diagram</p><p>Can I replace the current rubber seal with felt?</p>
<p>Maybe. The front of the engine moves. The ramp's aluminum is very light - I
am afraid that if I were to add any reasonable quantity of felt to it to hold
the seal tight it will warp the aluminum via relative motion of that ramp
(hooked up to the engine) rubbing on the bottom of the nosebowl.
Or worse yet, make a hole in the bowl.</p>
<p>Can I replace the ramp? Well, everything's possible; but that's a massive
undertaking. That ramp / nose baffle, Comanche-style, has that compound curve,
and I don't have time or skill to do it <em>fast</em>. 2 months? Maybe, if I get lucky.
BTW this is probably <em>why</em> Remo did it this way - because his is just an
aluminum sheet, wrapped around the front of the engine, &quot;neck cone&quot; style, and
cut to fit.</p>
<p>So, what do I do?</p>
<p>After discussing this at length with my good friend Ben, we settled on testing
this out first to see how bad the air flow going &quot;under&quot; will be. I can mark
the bottom of the nosebowl with some tinted oil, and go fly. Oil streaks will
tell me if the air is flowing under a lot, or not so much.</p>
<p>I'll also replace all the other baffle seals, which will improve cooling.
There's a lot of gaps to RTV, too.</p>
<p>I don't want to replace the bottom nosebowl ones, because actually there the
rigidity of old neoprene rubber seals should help...</p>

<h2>Fabric</h2>
<p>Fabric on this plane is old. Flyable from what I am being told by experts,
but old. Cracking, peeling paint.</p>
<p>Original logs say that she was covered in Polyfiber. But the current finish
looks more like Imron and the company - &quot;flexible&quot; automotive poly. It's
cracking and peeling around areas of high wear (prop wash, etc).</p>

<hr class="dashed"/><p>Only had a few hours today, so decided to concentrate on taking off the wing root fairings. As I mentioned before, the &quot;back-side accessible&quot;
screws were set up to have nuts on them rather than nutplates. Well, I don't know about that accessibility....</p>
<p>It ended up being 3 hours for ~30 screws.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Root fairing off</p><p>Most of them on the back side of the wing require you reaching with a wrench thru the rear cockpit, and my arm is just barely long enough
to do that successfully. Since nuts are nyloc, no way I can hold them with my fingers - they need a socket.</p>
<p>Some of those nuts are in a U-type channel over which the fabric is glued, and some of the holes are off-center: making it impossible to put a socket over them.</p>
<p>I could've ground a socket down; but I don't have a grinder - so especially one of the nuts took a while to get off. And oh, you have to do
all that without dropping the nut and the washer onto the floor (and having them go into the tail). So the process looked like this:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Get your hand in, try to put the socket over the nut.</li>
<li>While holding the ratchet,  try to put the screwdriver into the screw w/o missing it and poking a hole in the fabric.</li>
<li>Undo the screw, almost.</li>
<li>Remove the socket, take a strong magnet.</li>
<li>Finish undoing the screw, hoping that the magnet will catch the washer and the nut.</li>
</ul>
<p>Having magnetic sockets helped. They weren't deep enough to grab most of the fully tightened nuts because screws protruded from them. I used them as magnets sometimes, and sometimes used my magnetic &quot;fishing for lost hardware&quot; probe.</p>
<p>Now I'm writing this, I realized what I should've been doing is using a long extension and a 90 degree adapter on my socket. Damn! But this still doesn't solve
the problem with some of the nuts that were hidden almost behind things that were in the way (ie, a trim control wheel's attachment structure that's
welded into the fuselage).</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">One of those pesky nuts</p><p>I'm considering replacing those nuts with Tinnerman-type and screws with sheet metal screws thru Tinnermans. I'd put some anti-chafe tape inside the U-channel,
and then Tinnermans on top of it. Since Tinnermans are long, when undoing (or tightening) the screw, they will turn and touch the side of the U-channel, which will act as a wrench.</p>
