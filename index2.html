<hr class="dashed"/><p>Finally, doing some actual work on the airplane, and having fun! And I decided to start logging time.. because, why not!</p>
<div class="section" id="wire-marking">
<h2>Wire Marking</h2>
<p>I like marked wires. I used to be a networking guy, and I was very meticulous about marking every single wire in my cabinets, so that I knew
exactly what was plugged in where.</p>
<p>It took a bit of upfront time, but saved a bunch of it later on.</p>
<p>So naturally, I was planning to do the same on the Charger, and, more importantly, make it look <em>professional</em>.</p>
<p>Thanks to living in this day and age, that is simple. No, I'm not gonna pay someone to laser etch my wires - that's a cop out :). It's like
paying someone to paint your plane.</p>
<p>Instead, I have researched and found a perfect label maker - Brady BMP21 (not including a link here because it will probably go dead after
some time... just search for it). This thing has 3:1 heatshrink tube cartridges.</p>

<div class="section" id="fusible-links">
<h2>Fusible Links</h2>
<p>Every wire must be fused at the source. Well, almost every :). We don't fuse a couple wires like battery - master contactor: but this is
an exception rather than the rule.</p>
<p>Most wires are fused on the fuse block at the main buss. But some wires are impractical or impossible to have hooked up to that. Think ammeter
shunt wires as a classic example.</p>
<p>For those, most people use bulky, ugly, and generally eww-y inline fuses. But there's a better option! Enter fusible links.</p>
<p>The idea is simple: use a short length of wire 4 gauges smaller the wire to be fused. So if your wire to be fused is 20AWG, you would do:</p>
<p>Source -&gt; 24AWG -&gt; 20AWG where the 24AWG segment acts as a fuse. The idea is, in case of a short, that piece will burn first.</p>
<p>So, I wanted to convince myself that that will work fine for me.</p>
<p>Initially, me and my ham neighbor tried to use his ~30 amp power supply to do it. No joy. The best we could do is 22 amps, and (imagine that!) 24
gauge we were trying to burn held up to the abuse with no sweat at all! I could even hold it in my fingers. Yay, milspec wire!</p>
<p>So I decided to go rough. I do have a discarded old  battery, after all. It was time to burn some wires with it.</p>
<p>Here, the red wire is 20AWG, and the black wire is 24AWG. Using crimps for quick setup.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Boom!</p><p>It burnt real quick, in less than a second, and the protected (red) wire barely got hot (I was holding it - that was a part of the test). Yes, say
that I am unscientific all you want - milspec wire holds up to 150C, and I can't hold up to 150C. The 20GA wire got barely warm - which means it
won't cause any problems in a bundle.</p>
<p>It worked!</p>
<p>Now, it was time to set up a real one - to make sure that when the &quot;fuse&quot; wire burns, it doesn't damage anything.</p>
<p>B&amp;C sells very nice fiberglass tubing covered in silicone for exactly this purpose.</p>
<p>I also soldered the fuselink in this time - I wanted to see how well will the solder splices hold to the temps.</p>

sleeve will go over it.</p>

<p>I took it off to inspect.</p>

<p>I will need to play with different sizes of heatshrink and probably will use the glue lined strain relief kind just to support everything well, but
hey - this worked very well indeed!</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="load-measurements">
<h2>Load Measurements</h2>
<p>Prior to ripping the old wiring out, I wanted to take some real life load measurements with various things turned on,
so that I don't get any nasty surprises.</p>
<p>But this plane has no ammeter... damn. I searched around, and found this little doodad:</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-06-18-fuselinks/hamm.jpg" title="Hall Effect ammeter" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-06-18-fuselinks/hamm-thumb.jpg" title="Hall Effect ammeter" alt="Hall Effect ammeter" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Hall Effect ammeter</p><p>Very nice. It basically measures current on the wire passing thru this big white ring using Hall effect. Very cool! No need to splice into
the battery leads and install a temp shunt.</p>
<p>So, I rigged it up and took some numbers.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-06-18-fuselinks/amm-1.jpg" title="Rigged up" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-06-18-fuselinks/amm-1-thumb.jpg" title="Rigged up" alt="Rigged up" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Rigged up</p><ul class="simple">
<li>Master On: 1.5 amps<ul>
<li>Includes: Master Solenoid, and a couple of gauges</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Fuel Pump: 0.2 amps</li>
<li>&quot;Radios&quot; switch (turns on engine monitor, and power to radios: turning backlighting on them): 0.8 amps</li>
<li>I-Com Radio, Transmit: 2.6 amps</li>
<li>Intercom: 0.1 amps</li>
<li>Transponder: 1.1 amps</li>
<li>Smoke Oil pump: 2.2 - 2.6 amps (high on startup)</li>
</ul>
<p>So couple interesting things here. I think the x-der number is too low, but it wasn't being interrogated, and I can't make it be interrogated
without flying the plane or using a transponder tester which I don't have. Also, Master On is too high seemingly...
Will need to double check later and isolate things (master solenoid, hobbs, voltmeter, voltage regulator, fuel gauge) if I care enough - I don't
think I do. Also, fuel pump is too low seemingly. Need to double-check the spec.</p>
<p>And then, I could not turn on the Turn-Slip Indicator...</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="turn-slip-indicator">
<h2>Turn-Slip Indicator</h2>
<p>Sad, sad indicator... see, it's <em>long</em>. And it's wire connector is sticking out. And it's right behind the front seat's headrest, and there's
just not enough room for it, and the connector.</p>
<p>So whomever put it in... did this:</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-06-18-fuselinks/ts-1.jpg" title="Sad, sad wiring" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-06-18-fuselinks/ts-1-thumb.jpg" title="Sad, sad wiring" alt="Sad, sad wiring" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Sad, sad wiring</p><p>It's hard to see; but basically, those wires are bent &quot;down&quot; at a very sharp 90 degrees angle. Notice how he just used pins without the
actual connector. The distance between them is tiny! I am surprised they haven't shorted over all these years. I really am.</p>
<p>Initially, I thought the gauge didn't turn on because that wiring was all bust up, so to test it, I decided to pull it out.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-06-18-fuselinks/ts-2.jpg" title="On the bench" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-06-18-fuselinks/ts-2-thumb.jpg" title="On the bench" alt="On the bench" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">On the bench</p><p>I cut off the wires with those pins on them to hook it up to my testing battery... hmm.. but I needed some leads! Well, I was gonna
make a bunch of various test leads - so this is as good a time as any! Man, I love soldering...</p>
<p>I long decided to make a bunch of leads with &quot;passthru&quot; banana plugs on one end, and something (a crocodile clamp, a battery clamp,
a ring terminal) on the other. This way, I could mix and match, and plug them into my multimeter; daisy chain, and have multiples
depending on what and how I needed to hook up. I had all the bits (clamps, crocodiles, banana plugs), and even got a roll of very nice super
flexible silicone coated probe wire.</p>

<p>But I had resistance between + and -. And I had voltage! Hmmm..</p>
<p>Second time I hooked it up, I saw a bit of a spark when I put the positive clamp to the battery, and heard something.</p>
<p>I spun the gyro with my finger.... it spun up!</p>
<p>Well, well. So that gyro &quot;froze&quot; in a bit... Yep, it was hard to turn over with a finger - no doubt a small motor in there had a hard time!</p>
<p>I probably &quot;cleared it up&quot; a bit when turning it over with my fingers - but that won't last long... damn.</p>
<p>Are we looking at the overhaul for this thing too now? Sigh.... Maybe I can find parts
to do that myself, but not so sure about that.... It's not common for owners to overhaul their instruments - they're precision clockwork, after
all...</p>
<p>Oh well.</p>
<p>And I will have to figure out how to solve that wiring problem with no space to hook up the right type connector. I am thinking along the
lines of maybe routing a wire from inside of the gauge down thru a hole I'd drill, a grommet it it, and covering the whole business with
with some sealant or something, so that the dust doesn't get in. we'll see. Need to ponder this a bit more.</p>

<hr class="dashed"/><p>Well, since it seems now that my Hangar will become my shop for a while with me doing the
<a class="reference external" href="http://79ft.net/entries/2019-05-16-fire-hazard/">electrical rebuild</a> on the Charger,
I decided to set myself up in it. I am still rebuilding the main shop at the house (reminder: need to write up a couple notes on that),
so the only place I have to work on the plane is in the hangar - and frankly, I probably wouldn't have dragged the whole thing over
to the house anyway just for an electrical rebuild... though it is getting hot, and being in a tin can of a hangar when it's 100 degrees outside
is not.. pleasant, shall we say.</p>
<p>At any rate, the Hangar is now to be officially known as The Dream Shop, Georgetown Annex!</p>
<p>Not much to tell - but much to show here.</p>
<div class="section" id="easy-route">
<h2>Easy Route</h2>
<p>I didn't have anything in the hangar besides a couple of old bookshelves, a couple of small tables, a few filing cabinets I have inherited from my
good friend Pete, and a cart. Not very nicely set up for working on airplanes, and everything was overflowing with parts, tools,
and hardware even after just a bit of disassembly I have done for the annual.</p>
<p>I needed a lot of shelf space, and a lot of bench space.</p>
<p>I decided to take an easy route this time, and instead of building everything, just bought a bunch of shelves at Costco, and benches
and a tool cart at ... Harbor Freight. Yep, I know. Throw a rotten egg in my face next time you see me.</p>

<div class="section" id="the-light">
<h2>The Light</h2>
<p>I work evenings a lot, and the only light source there was there was a four T8 tube fixture in the back of the hangar.
But the most interesting stuff is on the front of it (engine, yep :) ). So I added some lights around the front.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-06-17-hangar-redo/hr-2.jpg" title="Lights" >

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Lights</p></div>
<div class="section" id="the-benches">
<h2>The Benches</h2>
<p>Next, came the benches from Harbor Freight. Don't buy them. They're built like crap, and, frankly, I think I could've built better ones out of
2x4s in about the same amount of time it took me to put these together... But hey, I already bought them, and disassembling the first one
(I got three total) rather than putting the other two together... I didn't want to...</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-06-17-hangar-redo/hr-3.jpg" title="Benches" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-06-17-hangar-redo/hr-3-thumb.jpg" title="Benches" alt="Benches" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Benches</p><p>You might notice the pegboard at the back &quot;wall&quot; of those benches. Well, they attach it every about 12 inches around the perimeter with machine
screws and nuts. Guess what happened to the first pegboard after a humidity cycled high, and then low? Yep; it all warped!</p>
<p>Ended up resorting to straightening it out with shelves that acted as &quot;stiffeners&quot;,  and putting the warped pegboard bench as far
away from the &quot;main&quot; bench as possible).</p>
<p>On the other two I actually made the pegboard &quot;floating&quot; - re-drilled the mounting holes to be large, and used large washers and just enough
small washers underneath to MacGyver me a &quot;bushing&quot;. That worked, and the other two benches' pegboard is straight after quite a few large
humidity changes now.</p>
<p>And then, the sink.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-sink">
<h2>The Sink</h2>
<p>I long had a large 7 gallon jug with a tap. When I was doing a lot of work, I'd drag it out of the hangar, put it on a small folding table, and
use it to wash my hands. Very nice to be able to do that when your hands are covered in oil and crud, and you need to climb into the airplane
or grab something generally clean. I also like clean hands when doing detail work like soldering, painting, etc.</p>

<p>The best part? The hangar door slides, so I can have it <em>closed</em> and then slide it a bit past it's &quot;closed&quot; position, so that there's a gap
between the hangar divider wall and the outside for the drain to be put out.</p>
<p>But how do I close the door?</p>

<h2>The Wiring</h2>
<p><em>Before you wire your plane, wire your hangar</em>, says a proverb. Or something like that.</p>
<p>Well, my hangar floods. And it's not <em>my</em> hangar, so I can't quite make holes in the walls and run wiring and conduit. And I only have one outlet.
Yep.</p>
<p>So it was all to be a bunch of extension cords, making sure that all connections are suspended a few inches above the floor, hooked to
something (previous tenant of my hangar had some holes in the walls drilled, so I reused his, or hooked them up to legs of whatever was there, etc).</p>
<p>I ended up making a bunch of splices on extension cords. Hey, I love soldering!</p>

<hr class="dashed"/><p>So after <a class="reference external" href="http://79ft.net/entries/2019-05-16-fire-hazard/">having discovered the electrical mess</a>, I realized that she's gonna be sitting
for a while.</p>
<p>Which meant...</p>
<p>Pickle time! Damn, this pickling thing is becoming a thing, excuse my tautologies...</p>
<p>I had to put her together enough to be able to run the engine to circulate and
warm up pickling oil.</p>
<p>And she was apart. With intakes off, TBI almost off, no oil, and such.</p>
<div class="section" id="fuel-intakes">
<h2>Fuel / Intakes</h2>
<p>So first, it was to be intakes.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-05-17-race-for-the-engine/p-2.jpg" title="RTV where there should be none" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-05-17-race-for-the-engine/p-2-thumb.jpg" title="RTV where there should be none" alt="RTV where there should be none" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">RTV where there should be none</p><p>Somebody put RTV to &quot;seal&quot; the intake gasket. Oh well.</p>
<p>Did you know that those 1 1/2 inch rubber hoses that go on intake tubes
are much easier with very thin coat of oil?</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-05-17-race-for-the-engine/p-5.jpg" title="Oiling the hoses" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-05-17-race-for-the-engine/p-5-thumb.jpg" title="Oiling the hoses" alt="Oiling the hoses" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Oiling the hoses</p><p>And then, it was the TBI.</p>
<p>Recall that when I was <a class="reference external" href="http://79ft.net/entries/2019-05-17-annual/">putting her apart</a>, I found pipe dope on the TBI inlet port?</p>
<p>Let me explain.</p>
<p>Fuel goes into gascolator. Then it branches: one branch goes to the engine driven pump, the other goes to the electric pump. Then, they go to the regulator on the TBI. Then, a couple of 90 degree fittings feed it into the TBI's inlet port, which has the &quot;last chance&quot; screen in it.</p>
<p>That's the port here, right above the airflow straightener:</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-05-17-race-for-the-engine/p-1.jpg" title="TBI from the down low" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-05-17-race-for-the-engine/p-1-thumb.jpg" title="TBI from the down low" alt="TBI from the down low" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">TBI from the down low</p><p>See that white gunk? That's Teflon dope. &quot;Aircraft grade&quot;; whatever.</p>
<p>Here's the problem.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-05-17-race-for-the-engine/p-4.jpg" title="TBI inlet hole" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-05-17-race-for-the-engine/p-4-thumb.jpg" title="TBI inlet hole" alt="TBI inlet hole" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">TBI inlet hole</p><p>Fuel has to go there, into that inlet hole. That's what the screen fitting screws into. Right past that, inside the TBI itself, there's a turn, another turn, and
a spray bar that sprays gas into the intake, injection-style, thru a tube
with a bunch of tiny holes. That's why there are screens in the fuel system:
to prevent gunk from clogging up those tiny holes.</p>
<p>So now, what happens when you take a <em>male</em> fitting out of a <em>female</em> threaded hole, and the fitting was doped? Some of that stuff ends up on the female portion. Next time the fitting is put in, dope remnants will be pushed in past the engaged threads, and possibly clog up the works.</p>
<p>Not. Good. At. All.</p>
<p>That's why there is the copper crush gasket behind that screen fitting - to seal it to the TBI body w/o requiring anything extra. You can kinda see that gasket all
smudged around with that dope on the first picture.</p>
<p>So I had to deal with it.. Clean it out somehow.</p>
<p>It was crumbly, but sticky enough to not want to come out.</p>
<p>I tried every solvent on hand. Nope.</p>
<p>I tried carefully scraping it out with a dental probe. Yeah, kinda worked,
but I wasn't satisfied.</p>
<p>I tried every solvent in my buddy Dick's hangar. Nope.</p>
<p>In desperation, I drove to the local Home.. strike that, Aerospace, Depot, thinking
about picking up every kind of solvent they had and I didn't.</p>
<p>And then, I remembered this:</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-05-17-race-for-the-engine/p-3.jpg" title="Goof-OFF!" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-05-17-race-for-the-engine/p-3-thumb.jpg" title="Goof-OFF!" alt="Goof-OFF!" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Goof-OFF!</p><p>I don't know what kind of concoction that is; but it worked! The hole was clean.
Next time was a couple days after, and when I got back to the hangar, I discovered that it has turned into a lake :(</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-05-17-race-for-the-engine/p-7.jpg" title="Lake in my hangar" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-05-17-race-for-the-engine/p-7-thumb.jpg" title="Lake in my hangar" alt="Lake in my hangar" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Lake in my hangar</p><p>Grading's all screwed up around our hangars, and when we get lots and lots of
rain, they flood. Not too much though, luckily. This was the second time in
the past few weeks - first time, I had my tools scattered around the floor.
This time, I was smarter...</p>
<p>Anyway, back to the TBI. The rest of it went together quite nicely. I discovered
that there was TorqueSeal put on the idle mixture screw.</p>
<p>Why? No idea. That screw is spring loaded. Should stay put.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Torque Seal where there should be none</p><p>I wanted to flush the lines and then the TBI to make absolutely sure
none of that dope went it. The best way to do that would be with the electrical
pump; but I'm a one man show.... and the switch for it is 5 feet away from the
firewall.</p>
<p>So, I had to rig me up a little doodad.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">A recipe for a mess...</p><p>After filling the sump up, it was time to check for oil pressure. Lycoming
tells you in SB1241C  to pre-oil your engine by cranking with the starter in
10-30 second bursts until oil pressure comes up to 20 PSI.</p>
<p>Well, oil pressure gauge on the Charger is finicky, so I wanted it to at least
move.</p>
<p>Oh wait. She has an ignition/start switch. No way I can use that to crank and
not have a hot mag w/o messing with P-Leads.</p>
<p>Crap.</p>
<p>Also, I might want to crank from around the firewall (the prop was still off).</p>
<p>But I had my pushbutton doodad!</p>
<p>So I rigged it up to the starter solenoid this time.</p>
<p>Of course I misunderstood the way the starter solenoid was wired.</p>
<p>It had two terminals.</p>
<p>I thought one of them was ground; with the wire going to the firewall.
The other then was supposed to be positive.</p>
<p>That didn't work.</p>
<p>I measured it - between those terminals - nothing. &quot;Dead starter solenoid&quot;,
I though. Crap! It was 8pm. Auto parts stores were closing soon.</p>
<p>I rushed to a nearby O'Reilly. Picked up a starter solenoid. Went back.</p>
<p>Measured it too. NOTHING? How come? Something was amiss.</p>
<p>Only then I started suspecting that something was off. That other terminal on
the original starter solenoid I was hooking my positive wire to was all
corroded and looked like it never had a nut.</p>
<p>OH! The way it's supposed to be wired is that positive goes to the <em>same</em>
terminal where that wire I thought to have been ground was. It wasn't a
ground wire - it was a <em>diode</em>. And the ground was off of the case of the
solenoid.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So, we're cranking now.</p>
<p>30 seconds. No pressure.
30 more. No pressure. Crap!</p>
<p>I unhooked the oil pressure sending hose (the one that hooks up to the line
that goes to the gauge).</p>
<p>Crank. No oil. A couple bubbles is all I got.</p>
<p>CRAP!</p>
<p>The oil pump de-primed itself?</p>
<p>Kinda makes sense I guess? The plane was sitting for way too long :(</p>
<p>So, I took off the oil cooler return line. Dumped another quart of oil in there.</p>
<p>I had this hose fitting that goes on top of an oil bottle that was very neatly
set up to mate with the engine oil hose's flare: so I could squeeze the bottle and push the oil in.</p>
<p>After the whole quart, I re-hooked the line back onto the oil cooler, and tried
again.</p>
<p>Success! Now, I saw oil coming out of the oil pressure sending hose.</p>
<p>Hooked it up to the gauge line, and saw the gauge move, finally. Good.</p>
<p>Damn, with all that cranking I ran out my old battery I had put in there.</p>
<p>Now, have to flip the battery (to put in the good one - the flying one - I always use my old battery from the Cheetah when I mess with electrical, not to abuse the actual &quot;production&quot; battery).</p>
<p>Now, the top spark plugs go back in, the ignition wires get hooked up.</p>
<p>Prop time!</p>
<p>Bolt one - start it in.
Bolt two.
Bolt three.</p>
<p>Bolt 4. Doesn't go in? Not even a chance? What the hell?</p>
<p>I pulled the prop back off and laid it down. Put the front crush plate on top
(that one positions the bolts).</p>
<p>No matter what I did, there'd be at least 3 out of 6 bolts that won't go in.
This time, it was a few dry days, and I guess the prop moved enough to
have the &quot;top&quot; and &quot;bottom&quot; holes (if looking at the prop horizontally) move
closer together. It was off by almost a 1/16th.</p>
<p>So here I was. With an engine that was cranked for a total of a few minutes,
and probably had scraped a lot of oil off of cam lobes and lifters.</p>
<p>With a prop.</p>
<p>I couldn't put on.</p>
<p>Which I needed.</p>
<p>To fire the damn thing up.</p>
<p>It was late. I tidied up, and went home.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-prop">
<h2>The Prop</h2>
<p>I wrote a note to Frank Johnson who made the prop that same night, and called him the next day.</p>
<p>He wasn't surprised. &quot;Redrill&quot; is a simple fix.</p>
<p>But I was a bit apprehensive, and this was a nice excuse to meet him. He's
2 hours away from me. We agreed to meet in a few days, at the first time
he was available.</p>
<p>So, the engine with oil scraped off the lobes had to sit for another couple
days.</p>
<p>Nothing I could do in that short a time...</p>

<hr class="dashed"/><p>This thing nagged me for a while. The Charger did not have the Field breaker.
For that matter, it didn't have the Alternator master breaker, either.</p>
<p>It had this weird &quot;main buss&quot; breaker for 60 amps, but that didn't look
like the Alternator breaker to me.</p>
<p>So in between dealing with other things after having decided to
put her thru <a class="reference external" href="/category/chickenhouse-charger2019-annual.html">Annual in 2019</a>
a bit early, I was running around with my multimeter, tracing wires.</p>
<p>Initially, I quickly discovered that some lines were definitely not fused;
like Battery -&gt; Main Buss line, and thought I'd put inline fuses
into them, and be done.</p>
<p>She has an old charging system; a <em>mechanical</em> switching voltage regulator, and
a Delco Remy alternator seemingly from a tractor:</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-05-16-fire-hazard/fh-1.jpg" title="The old Delco-Remy" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-05-16-fire-hazard/fh-1-thumb.jpg" title="The old Delco-Remy" alt="The old Delco-Remy" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">The old Delco-Remy</p><p>Voltage regulator didn't make sense. It had 4 wires (should be 2: supply and
field output, or 3: supply, sense, and field output).</p>
<p>Alternator didn't make sense. Instead of 1 wire for Field input, it had
two wires.</p>
<p>Additionally, Battery Contactor didn't make sense. One terminal had a wire
going to it. The other was grounded....</p>
<div class="section" id="interlude">
<h2>Interlude</h2>
<p>Battery Contactor is an interesting point here. Normally, one terminal
is connected to the &quot;always hot&quot; side of it (basically, directly to the battery)
and the other goes to the Master Switch. Master Switch turns the Battery
Contactor on by grounding that wire, providing the negative side to the circuit.
It's a safety thing. If that wire breaks, it'll either turn the electrical off
(open circuit), or it will keep it turned on (short to ground). That's it.</p>
<p>But, one of the terminals on the Battery Contactor was grounded... that means,
that the other terminal (the wire coming from the Master Switch) must provide
positive side??? Huh? But where does it get it's power <em>from</em>?</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="tracing">
<h2>Tracing</h2>
<p>So to tracing we went. I spend maybe 10 hours trying to find diagrams
and understand that alternator and voltage regulator hookups.</p>
<p>And me tracing it spelled my doom.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-diagram">
<h2>The Diagram</h2>
<p>Now, I didn't trace the rest of it. Just the main distribution system. That was
enough.</p>
<p>Shall we?</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-05-16-fire-hazard/fh-2.jpg" title="The current  main power system of the Charger" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-05-16-fire-hazard/fh-2-thumb.jpg" title="The current  main power system of the Charger" alt="The current  main power system of the Charger" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">The current  main power system of the Charger</p><p>Yep, the diagram is missing the main power buss. It's dangling off of the
same spot where everything else that's interesting is - the
Battery Contactor (marked MA RELAY) &lt;-&gt; Starter Contactor (marked STARTER REL)
link.</p>
<p>So let's see what we have here.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Lots of unfused wires. Do you see a <em>single</em> fuse here? Nope. That's because there aren't any. All the fuses are further downstream, off of the main buss.</li>
<li>Voltage Regulator has this extra wire running to / from cockpit that isn't really necessary and could've been kept on the hot side of the firewall (terminal 4 wire)</li>
<li>Alternator field broken at <em>output</em> (F-&gt;ALT) rather than at <em>input</em> (battery -&gt; terminal 3)</li>
<li>And the best part? <strong>Always hot wire that you can't turn off</strong> between the battery and the Master Switch to turn the Master Solenoid on.</li>
</ul>
<p>That last bit bugged me. I couldn't <em>find</em> the damn thing. Even before
actually tracing it, I knew that if the Master Solenoid is switched on the &quot;hot&quot;
side, it needs to get the power from somewhere, and that only could be battery. But I didn't see <em>any</em> wires on the always hot side of the Master Solenoid.
Only when I traced it, I actually traced the physical wire to where it goes, and
then found it. It was so tucked behind the battery -&gt; Master Solenoid wire that
it was invisible:</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-05-16-fire-hazard/fh-5.jpg" title="This little !@#!S@#...." >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-05-16-fire-hazard/fh-5-thumb.jpg" title="This little !@#!S@#...." alt="This little !@#!S@#...." >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">This little !@#!S@#....</p><p>Oh; and by the way, the Master Switch is the only switch that's <em>soldered</em> in,
and w/o any good insulation around the terminals, and over-stripped wires.
So that's just waiting to short, and the magic smoke that'll be let out
behind the panel when that shorts can't be stopped (always hot wire, remember?)</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-05-16-fire-hazard/fh-3.jpg" title="Master Switch" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-05-16-fire-hazard/fh-3-thumb.jpg" title="Master Switch" alt="Master Switch" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Master Switch</p></div>
<div class="section" id="the-wires">
<h2>The Wires</h2>
<p>So I kinda went backwards here; but I thought it'd be easier to see the
diagram first.</p>
<p>Let's see.</p>
<p>Most of connections are made on this very nicely marked terminal block:</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-05-16-fire-hazard/fh-4.jpg" title="The terminal block" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-05-16-fire-hazard/fh-4-thumb.jpg" title="The terminal block" alt="The terminal block" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">The terminal block</p><p>All the switched power comes out there, and every wire is marked. This
actually helped a lot in tracing. This block is on the side of the plane,
right next to the front hole's backrest.</p>
<p>You know what threw me off the most with that damned always hot wire
(I ended up tracing it <em>physically</em>)? It's how it's hooked up.</p>
<p>Yep, it is hooked up to that terminal block. To the terminal... that is
marked.. (drumroll).... &quot;Master Switch&quot;.</p>
<p>Wait.. this actually makes sense... But where's the &quot;return&quot; from the switch?</p>
<p>Ah! It's the wire that's marked.... drumroll... &quot;Fuel Gauge&quot;!</p>
<p>So really, let's look at what's going on, shall we? Zoom in the image below, it's annotated.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-05-16-fire-hazard/fh-explained.jpg" title="Untangled" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-05-16-fire-hazard/fh-explained-thumb.jpg" title="Untangled" alt="Untangled" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Untangled</p><p>So let's see. We've got this bundle of wires, a lot of which are not fused,
and one of which is always hot.</p>
<p>The Main Buss wire is the thickest one (10 gauge maybe?) that's not fused
between this buss bar and the source (engine compartment).</p>
<p>Oh, did I mention that this buss bar is on the side of the plane near the
rear instrument panel (so that 10 gauge run, and the rest of the harness
between firewall and the panel is about 30 inches long)?</p>
<p>What else do we see there? Oh! The two little 1/16inch thick aluminum lines
carrying.. fuel pressure (and oil pressure).</p>
<p>Shall I say more?</p>
<p>Shall I say that there's a fuel tank in between the front hole (passenger) and
the firewall?</p>
<p>That the wires run along between firewall and rear cockpit along that fuel
pressure line (to fuel pressure gauge)?</p>
<p>That if one shorts to this very nearby fuel pressure line, it'll burn a hole
straight thru it, and then ignite the gas that'll start coming out?</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>Can I fix all of that?</p>
<p>Sure. But rewiring will be much much easier, because I have to touch pretty much
everything. Re-running half of individual wires in a bundle is much harder than
re-running them all.</p>
<p>So, I made a decision to rewire the plane... Sigh. Looks like I won't be
flying for a looooong time.</p>
<p>Oh, and tell you what. Tracing wires on a biplane is dangerous. I ended up twisting my knee and pulling a muscle while trying to get behind the panel so badly that I couldn't walk (or sit) for 2.5 days :(.</p>

<hr class="dashed"/><p>Baffle seals on this plane are original reinforced neoprene
rubber, and they were in pretty beat up shape. There is a lot of gaps,
they sag in places, making the seal really not that good.</p>
<p>So one of the things I decided to do is to redo them.</p>
<p>Pardon the cruddy pictures; but those ones are the only ones I have :(</p>
<div class="section" id="the-nosebowl">
<h2>The Nosebowl</h2>
<p>One of the things I noticed immediately is that baffle seals were turned the
wrong way in the nosebowl area; where the front &quot;air ramp&quot; joins the bottom of
the nosebowl.</p>
<p>Here's the nosebowl and the front ramp:</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-05-17-cowling-conundrum/cc1.jpg" title="Front ramp" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-05-17-cowling-conundrum/cc1-thumb.jpg" title="Front ramp" alt="Front ramp" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Front ramp</p><p>Notice the circled area? Here it is, from the back:</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-05-17-cowling-conundrum/cc2.jpg" title="The behinds" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-05-17-cowling-conundrum/cc2-thumb.jpg" title="The behinds" alt="The behinds" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">The behinds</p><p>That marked rubber seal is in the circled area. Notice it's turned the wrong
way; &quot;into&quot; the cowling, rather than away from it? Ram air hitting that
front &quot;ramp&quot; will &quot;bend it in&quot;, and leak into the underside of the engine
compartment - precisely where it's <em>not</em> supposed to go.</p>
<p>Naive me thought that it was just wrongly installed - the rubber needed to have been folded up and out, &quot;into&quot; the lip of the nosebowl.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-05-17-cowling-conundrum/cc3.jpg" title="Correct and current seal orientation" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-05-17-cowling-conundrum/cc3-thumb.jpg" title="Correct and current seal orientation" alt="Correct and current seal orientation" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Correct and current seal orientation</p><p>Ha! Well, Remo (the guy who built the Charger) thought different.</p>
<p>There's just not enough <em>room</em> there. Everything is super tight.
The seal just won't go there and <em>stay</em> there. There's just no room.</p>
<p>Look at the above two pictures - inside and outside - again. You'll understand
why. Use pop rivet line as your reference.</p>
<p>Here's where the problem gets worse.
Ramp is really <em>thin</em> - so with just a mild pressure, I can make that gap
between the ramp and the bowl 1/4 - 3/8 inches. Guess what happens when ram
air hits it... :)</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">What ram air does...</p><p>Okay, so then I went digging.</p>
<p>I thought this was a <em>standard</em> bowl.
I was right!</p>
<p>It's an old Comanche single style bowl (I think).</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Changer vs. the Comanche</p><p>This is cross section. Mine's on the left, Comanche's on the right.
Red is nosebowl; blue is this ramp, and black is my baffle seal.</p>
<p>Mine is &quot;concave&quot;. Comanche is &quot;convex&quot;. So if I got my thinking right,
this makes the Comanche version more rigid facing the wind.</p>
<p>Drawing from the Comanche's parts' manual confirms this proper curve.</p>

<p>But how the heck do they seal them? Notice that the material on the drawing
above seemingly  has some &quot;dots&quot; on it (as opposed to the rubber material on
the side baffles).</p>
<p>Well, back to our &quot;remade Comanche front baffles&quot; guy.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Forward baffles from Comanche Gear guy</p><p>Felt strip!</p>
<p>Well, I guess that makes sense. Felt wrapped <em>around</em> the front ramp.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-05-17-cowling-conundrum/cc11.jpg" title="Felt strip" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-05-17-cowling-conundrum/cc11-thumb.jpg" title="Felt strip" alt="Felt strip" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Felt strip</p><p>Felt is thick and, contacting the nosebowl, I guess, will create a good
enough seal if the ramp is rigid enough. I am guessing that Comanche's
ramps are way more rigid than mine due to that opposed curve.</p>
<p>So where are we at with all this?</p>
<p>Remo probably built this noseramp himself. It looks very custom.
It's too thin and doesn't have rigidity - ram air will flex bend it
&quot;into&quot; the cowling. It's not sealed properly practically along all of that
bottom edge between the bowl and the ramp.</p>
<p>The only hope for it is that it's aerodynamic-ish and looks like a
&quot;dozer blade&quot; - curved up. Maybe the nosebowl lip deflects the air enough
for it not to go under too much:</p>

   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-05-17-cowling-conundrum/cc12-thumb.jpg" title="Airflow diagram" alt="Airflow diagram" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Airflow diagram</p><p>Can I replace the current rubber seal with felt?</p>
<p>Maybe. The front of the engine moves. The ramp's aluminum is very light - I
am afraid that if I were to add any reasonable quantity of felt to it to hold
the seal tight it will warp the aluminum via relative motion of that ramp
(hooked up to the engine) rubbing on the bottom of the nosebowl.
Or worse yet, make a hole in the bowl.</p>
<p>Can I replace the ramp? Well, everything's possible; but that's a massive
undertaking. That ramp / nose baffle, Comanche-style, has that compound curve,
and I don't have time or skill to do it <em>fast</em>. 2 months? Maybe, if I get lucky.
BTW this is probably <em>why</em> Remo did it this way - because his is just an
aluminum sheet, wrapped around the front of the engine, &quot;neck cone&quot; style, and
cut to fit.</p>
<p>So, what do I do?</p>
<p>After discussing this at length with my good friend Ben, we settled on testing
this out first to see how bad the air flow going &quot;under&quot; will be. I can mark
the bottom of the nosebowl with some tinted oil, and go fly. Oil streaks will
tell me if the air is flowing under a lot, or not so much.</p>
<p>I'll also replace all the other baffle seals, which will improve cooling.
There's a lot of gaps to RTV, too.</p>
<p>I don't want to replace the bottom nosebowl ones, because actually there the
rigidity of old neoprene rubber seals should help...</p>

<h2>Annual, Continued</h2>
<p>We got together with John, my IA, and continued working on the plane
early April.</p>
<p>We pulled the prop, so that I will have access to baffles (I wanted to
redo them).</p>
<p>John re-riveted the air takeoff flange back to the front ramp.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I started disassembling the fuel system to get to the screens,
including the oil sump screen, and clean them.</p>

<p>I noticed evidence of possible intake leaks, so without &quot;burping&quot; the engine,
decided to pull the intakes and replace the gaskets. This is my karma. I did
that on the Cheetah just a year ago, and scraping remnants of one of those
gaskets and re-chasing the threads took me about 10 hours; maybe more.</p>

<hr class="dashed"/><p>Only had a few hours today, so decided to concentrate on taking off the wing root fairings. As I mentioned before, the &quot;back-side accessible&quot;
screws were set up to have nuts on them rather than nutplates. Well, I don't know about that accessibility....</p>
<p>It ended up being 3 hours for ~30 screws.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Root fairing off</p><p>Most of them on the back side of the wing require you reaching with a wrench thru the rear cockpit, and my arm is just barely long enough
to do that successfully. Since nuts are nyloc, no way I can hold them with my fingers - they need a socket.</p>
<p>Some of those nuts are in a U-type channel over which the fabric is glued, and some of the holes are off-center: making it impossible to put a socket over them.</p>
<p>I could've ground a socket down; but I don't have a grinder - so especially one of the nuts took a while to get off. And oh, you have to do
all that without dropping the nut and the washer onto the floor (and having them go into the tail). So the process looked like this:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Get your hand in, try to put the socket over the nut.</li>
<li>While holding the ratchet,  try to put the screwdriver into the screw w/o missing it and poking a hole in the fabric.</li>
<li>Undo the screw, almost.</li>
<li>Remove the socket, take a strong magnet.</li>
<li>Finish undoing the screw, hoping that the magnet will catch the washer and the nut.</li>
</ul>
<p>Having magnetic sockets helped. They weren't deep enough to grab most of the fully tightened nuts because screws protruded from them. I used them as magnets sometimes, and sometimes used my magnetic &quot;fishing for lost hardware&quot; probe.</p>
<p>Now I'm writing this, I realized what I should've been doing is using a long extension and a 90 degree adapter on my socket. Damn! But this still doesn't solve
the problem with some of the nuts that were hidden almost behind things that were in the way (ie, a trim control wheel's attachment structure that's
welded into the fuselage).</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">One of those pesky nuts</p><p>I'm considering replacing those nuts with Tinnerman-type and screws with sheet metal screws thru Tinnermans. I'd put some anti-chafe tape inside the U-channel,
and then Tinnermans on top of it. Since Tinnermans are long, when undoing (or tightening) the screw, they will turn and touch the side of the U-channel, which will act as a wrench.</p>

<li>She has the Rotec TBI-40-MKI TBI installed, which requires a 40 mesh filter <em>upstream</em> of it. The only filter besides finger strainers in tanks is gascolator, which goes down to 72 micron (0.003) only. Need to get a hold of Rotec people and discuss this situation.</li>
<li>The &quot;low&quot; end of the tank (in 3-point attitude) has a very nice drain fitting + drain cock draining behind the cowl. I am seriously considering adding a quick drain there - that <em>is</em> the lowest point of the tank in 3-point. My thinking is: water collected in the tank, goes to that lowest point; but there's not enough of it to go thru the take-off (which is in the middle). Then, when I raise the tail, it slushes forward, goes into the take-off, and reaches the engine right when I am just off the runway. Not Good.</li>
<li>Some un-critical drain hoses are clear vinyl and hard as a rock. For now will replace them with clear polyurethane, and if that hardens, with rubber.</li>
<li>TBI needs positive stops on the throttle quadrant. Need to check if they're present and adjust as necessary.</li>
</ul>

<p>Spent the rest of the day taking off fairings and access panels. This is the first thing I thing could've been done better here methinks. Everywhere where
it was deemed that the back side would be &quot;accessible&quot;, Remo used #6-32 nyloc AN nuts on machine screws instead of nutplates. Well, some of those nuts
are <em>not</em> accessible, and I gave up on quite a bit of them around the rear wing root fairings.</p>

<h2>Fade In</h2>
<p>I met Glenn and Judi in 2014.</p>
<p>This was my second Oshkosh, and the first time I noticed the Biplane Forum's
Beer'O'Clock thread.</p>
<p>We had two &quot;events&quot; that year: one in the Vintage at the
awesome Piper Pub (yep, the spelling is right - it was a Tri-Pacer with the
baggage door that had a beer tap. The guy who owned it claimed he had an STC;
but paperwork got soaked in beer and was drying somewhere). We sneaked in a large
cooler of Austin sour beer then, hauling it all the way from the opposite end of Camp
Scholler. I met Glenn there, and later that night washed out in his camp and was fed
with a kick-ass grilled cheese sandwich, and met Judi.</p>
<p>The second &quot;event&quot; was at Glenn's airplane, parked near Homebuilder's HQ. It was a beautiful
Marquart Charger, I learned then; a 1987 Golden Lindy recipient, built by Remo Galeazzi in Petaluma, CA.</p>
<p>That biplane was beautiful; just the right curves and not as aggressive as more modern ones like Pitts and Skybolts.
It looked straight from the 1930s, with wooden prop tipping the nose. I fell in love with it.</p>
<p>In 2015, we've had a good crowd around the plane.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-03-27-meet-81G/osh15.jpg" title="Oshkosh 2015 Biplane Forum Beer'o'Clock crowd" >

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Oshkosh 2015 Biplane Forum Beer'o'Clock crowd</p><p>Glenn's Charger became a traditional spot for these beer get-togethers, and we became friends who only met at Oshkosh; but to me
it felt like I knew Glenn for my whole life, and 11.5 months between AirVentures felt like hours.</p>
<p>In 2016, I was finally around Chicago where Glenn lived, and he took me out to his home field, Poplar Grove.
Man, what an airport! Just the right kind for his plane. We spent a day there, and I think I have seen only <em>one</em> spam can
and maybe one RV. The others were a few Cubs, a Twin Beech, a Waco, and the like. A few friends showed up, and that day I got
a ride in an AcroSport bipe, and later in the evening, finally, in the Charger.</p>
<p>Oh man. I flew a couple sport biplanes before; and while I liked them, they were too much for this lazy guy. Just a bit too twitchy and
too sensitive.</p>
<p>This plane? It flew just like a Grumman. Perfect control harmony. Perfect, light forces on both elevator and ailerons. It fit like a glove.</p>
<p>Then, that night, by the way, I started seriously reconsidering building a Skybolt (BTW, this site was started as a Builder's Log for a Skybolt).
I flew one, and while I still liked the plane, I liked the Charger even more.</p>
<p>Especially with it's more &quot;classic&quot; looks (and come on, admit it, we pick biplanes for looks), and it's perfect flyability.</p>
<p>In 2017, we did Beer'o'Clock at my camp (I forget why.. maybe the Charger wasn't around).</p>
<p>And later that year, Glenn told me he's thinking about selling it. He got too much stuff on his hands, and didn't want to neglect the Grand Champion.</p>
<p>I thought for about a day. I loved <a class="reference external" href="http://79ft.net/tag/9891u.html">my Cheetah</a>, and I loved the fact that it was a &quot;normal&quot; airplane. I could take my 2 year old son up
in it. Not in a biplane. I could take &quot;normal&quot; people up in a Cheetah. Not in an open cockpit biplane - at least, it's a bit more.. rough, shall we say?</p>
<p>But I couldn't let the plane I loved just be sold on the Barnstormers; so the next day I told Glenn I'll take care of her when the time comes. I was overwhelmed,
and honored to have a chance of taking care of a piece of aviating and homebuilding history.</p>

<h2>The Plane</h2>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-03-27-meet-81G/beauty.jpg" title="The MA5 Charger" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-03-27-meet-81G/beauty-thumb.jpg" title="The MA5 Charger" alt="The MA5 Charger" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">The MA5 Charger</p><p>She was built in 1982. From what I could gather, she was started in 1977. There were two guys who built two MA5 Chargers in a chickenhouse in Petaluma, CA.
Glenn's plane was built by Remo Galeazzi, and won the Golden Lindy in 1987. The other Charger won too by the way, some years earlier :).</p>
<p>Remo wrote a <a class="reference external" href="/pdfs/chicken-house-chargers.pdf">really nice article for Sport Aviation about both planes</a>.</p>
<p>Here's <a class="reference external" href="/pdfs/remos-charger.pdf">another article about the plane</a>.</p>
<p>Glenn changed it a bit, adding the smoke system, changing the prop to wood, and tweaking the induction and fuel systems. But the plane stayed all original
mostly - original engine, original fabric, and such.</p>
<p>Oh, and it's <em>the</em> Charger <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marquart_MA-5_Charger">on Wikipedia</a> :)!</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="logistics">
<h2>Logistics</h2>
<p>I told Glenn to give me 6 months heads up, so that I could work out the logistics.</p>
<p>See, I have lots of hours to be very comfy flying any common tricycle single. I didn't have enough experience to haul a <em>taildragger bipe</em> across the country
(Glenn moved to CA by then). I would have to learn how to fly it comfortably before embarking on the trip; and figure out the logistics.</p>
<p>But then, things went much faster than I thought.</p>
<p>At Oshkosh 2018, Glenn was telling me he's about to sell the plane. I realized I didn't have time to train enough, and that it would be better to train
in the Charger from the getgo. So the working plan became me renting a large-ish truck, and hauling the airplane over to Texas with wings off.</p>
<p>And then, Glenn offered to fly the plane over himself, as a good bye to her. I couldn't refuse.</p>
<p>September 2018, Glenn told me he's gonna fly the plane over soon. I put the Cheetah up for sale, and
<a class="reference external" href="http://79ft.net/entries/2018-11-21-bye/">said my last goodbyes to her</a> November 21, 2018. Then, life and weather intervened, and we couldn't set the
trip up till last weekend.</p>
<p>'It's warming up', Glenn texted me a week and a half ago.</p>
<p>A week after that text, he was wheels up en route to TX, with Judi in the front hole.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-trip">
<h2>The Trip</h2>
<p>That didn't last long. An hour and change later, Glenn was stuck in Bakersfield, just at the southern tip of Central Valley, CA. All mountain passes
were blocked by low ceilings...</p>
<p>What's funny was that I was flying.. strike that, being flown from San Jose to Los Angeles, continuing to Texas, the same day Glenn and Judi were stuck at Bakersfield. I saw the damn
clouds blocking the passes. They were maybe a mile wide!!!</p>
<p>This delayed them by about 24 hours, but the rest of the trip was fairly smooth. They did a lot of flying after being stuck in Bakersfield for practically a whole day, and
some hours the following day.</p>

walked me thru the basics. We tucked the airplane away.</p>

<h2>Fin</h2>
<p>It was all so fast, I was in the state of... denial? and disbelief? I started becoming overwhelmed when I got back home in the evening on that day, and opened up the
logbooks.</p>
<p>Remo's signatures and flight log.</p>
<p>Remo's letters.</p>
<p>Glenn's signatures and notes.</p>
<p>The letter from Remo to Glenn, with a bunch of pictures - just pictures of this Charger being built; mundane almost; but a part of the Champion's history.</p>

<hr class="dashed"/><p>Great weather today. A bit cold, but sunny, calm, and overall very promising.</p>
<p>I rolled out the Cheetah out of her hangar for the last time.</p>
<p>This was a weird feeling.</p>
<p>When you have an airplane sitting in the hangar 20 minutes away from your
house, you tend to sometimes put flying off.</p>
<p>It typically goes along these lines.</p>
<p>Hey, it's Saturday coming up. I gotta go bounce around! <em>check the weather</em>
Hmm...looks a bit iffy. Maybe I should do
<em>this-other-thing-around-the-house-shop-or-whatever-I-hadn't-gotten-around-to</em>.
Maybe, I'll go flying after that...</p>
<p>Evening rolls in, you're tired and not up for flying anymore.. Meanwhile,
weather was perfect the whole day!</p>
<p>&quot;Next week&quot;,
you think. And you go out next week, but this time it's something else that
pops up and you have to get to it later in the day, and instead of spending
half a day bouncing around, you buzz around the pattern for half an hour and
go back to your daily messes and stuff to do around the house.</p>
<p>Not every Saturday was like that since I got back to having time to do plane
stuff... but often, it did.</p>
<p>But this time, today. It was weird. The knowing that I am flying <em>her</em> for
the last time, that I am listening to GTU ATIS on <em>her</em> radios for the last
time, the last VOR to be tuned in, last turn direct to the destination, last
approach guy handing you over to your destination's Tower...</p>
<p>&quot;Field in sight&quot;...</p>
<p>On a day like today...</p>
<p>Sunny, silky smooth, a touch of clouds, with all the gauges' needles frozen
in place...</p>
<p>You remember all the good times you had together, and think... I'll miss you,
Cheetah!</p>
<p>I guess, in the Spirit of Thanksgiving..?</p>
<p>Thank you for all the wingovers, low passes over lakes, and river runs.</p>
<p>Thank you for all the kids we've flown as Young Eagles.</p>
<p>Thank you for getting my ass out of that fog along the coast of Madagorda Island (that one was the &quot;bag of luck&quot; to &quot;bag of experience&quot; type thing for sure!)</p>
<p>Thank you for all the <a class="reference external" href="/tag/9891u.html">fun I had messing with you</a>.</p>
<p>Thank you for that unique kind of smell that your inside smelled with (and my tiger LeRoy who lived in the plane still smells like you!)</p>
<p>Thank you for being a good plane and not giving me any trouble.</p>
<p>I hope I'll see you again sometime! And maybe then, we'll go bounce around
together again. Just like the good old times.</p>
