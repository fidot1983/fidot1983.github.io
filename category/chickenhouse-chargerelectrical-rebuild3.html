<hr class="dashed"/><p>So this was quite an effort - not because it was a sophisticated design, but rather because it took quite a bit of time
to lay out in a reasonable fashion...</p>
<p>Oh, and also, somewhere in between I had a break for Oshkosh and a work trip :).</p>
<p>I decided to post this in a form of design notes, so that I can go around asking people what they think...</p>
<div class="section" id="the-new-wiring-diagram">
<h2>The New Wiring Diagram</h2>
<p>I have posted it <a class="reference external" href="/files/6781G-new-electrical/6781G-wiring-diagram.pdf">in PDF over here</a>.</p>
<p>Wire length / drop / load calculations are in the <a class="reference external" href="/files/6781G-new-electrical/6781G-wiring-load-schedule.xlsx">Excel spreadhseet over here</a>.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The design is based on Figure Z-11 from AeroElectric Connection by Bob Nuckolls, with the following tweaks:<ul>
<li>I'm using the B&amp;C LR3C Voltage Regulator, so it's wiring has been incorporated</li>
<li>I dropped the Endurance and Main Battery busses</li>
<li>I have tweaked the starting switches circuit, main buss feeder, and how ammeter is hooked up - see below for discussion</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The diagram is laid out to generally clump the components together as they would be on the airplane. It initially might seem
convoluted - but it has a certain flow to it matching the locations of components. Start in bottom right corner for
battery/starter/alternator circuitry and go counter clockwise - this will effectively take you &quot;thru the airplane&quot; as
the components will be laid out; roughly</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="review-items-and-commentary-on-specifics">
<h2>Review Items and Commentary on Specifics</h2>
<div class="section" id="starter-circuitry">
<h3>Starter Circuitry</h3>
<p>My current take on my Starter and Mags circuitry is this:</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-08-11-design-v1/starting-circuit.gif" title="Starting and Mags Circuit" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-08-11-design-v1/starting-circuit.gif" title="Starting and Mags Circuit" alt="Starting and Mags Circuit" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Starting and Mags Circuit</p><p>This is a deviation from Z-11, with both switches having to be in the momentary up position for starter to engage. I like
this better for two reasons:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>It makes the act of starting the motor more explicit</li>
<li>It returns back to correct &quot;running&quot; position automatically</li>
</ul>
<p>I need to test the ergonomics of pressing up a couple switches together. If I don't like it, another alternative would be
to replace the &quot;Right Mag&quot; switch circuitry from -5 to -1: making the top position on it non-momentary (as noted on the diagram).
This will reduce the &quot;user-friendliness&quot; but will still keep the explicitness, especially with my using pull-to-unlock switches
from Honeywell.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="main-power-distribution">
<h3>Main Power Distribution</h3>
<p>The Charging and Buss circuitry excerpt below:</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-08-11-design-v1/power-distribution.gif" title="Power Distribution" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-08-11-design-v1/power-distribution.gif" title="Power Distribution" alt="Power Distribution" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Power Distribution</p><p>Note that:</p>
<p>Shunt is set up to be in the &quot;battery&quot; lead. I like &quot;battery lead&quot; style ammeters, showing charge current on the 12-o-clock-plus
segment, and discharge current on the 12-o-clock-minus segment.</p>
<p>Note that the buss feeder wire is protected by a slow-burn 35A current limiter. In Z-11, that wire is not protected at all. My
reasoning for this decision is that this wire is relatively long on my plane (around 4 feet), since fuse block is near the
rear cockpit. I wanted to protect it.</p>
<p>One area of concern here is that in the event of alternator short, the Ammeter Shunt will be a part of the alternator circuit that
will see a lot of current while the 40A slow burn opens up. My gutfeel says it should be able to handle it, but I am not sure. At
any rate, figure Z-11 has the same setup with shunt on the alternator's B-Lead.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="voltage-regulator-sense-wire">
<h3>Voltage Regulator Sense Wire</h3>
<p>LR3C Voltage Regulator needs a separate &quot;voltage sense&quot; wire that one would normally connect to the main buss. Since the
regulator in my case is closer to the firewall than to the buss (fuse) block, I am connecting it to the main battery
circuitry (jumper wire between Starter and Master contactors). This is somewhat a shorter run and seems that it will be
more logical to measure as close to the battery as possible (especially since I'm saving on wire lengths this way).
Seems sensible to me.</p>
<p>The sense wire will be 20 AWG, about 3' long, and connected via 24 AWG fuselink.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="voltage-regulator-field-supply-circuit">
<h3>Voltage Regulator Field Supply Circuit</h3>
<p>The circuit looks like this:</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-08-11-design-v1/field-supply.gif" title="Field Supply Circuit" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-08-11-design-v1/field-supply.gif" title="Field Supply Circuit" alt="Field Supply Circuit" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Field Supply Circuit</p><p>I copied the AeroElectric's figure Z-11 wire gauges here. In Z-11, everything upstream of Breaker is 18 AWG, and everything
downstream is 20 AWG, but it's not explained why.</p>
<p>Is this driven by a requirement to ensure that fuselink survives the short in the circuit in case of crowbaring, and the
breaker pops first, w/o endangering the fuselink much (18 AWG allows for 22 AWG fuselink instead of 24 AWG)?</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="components-location-and-main-connector">
<h3>Components Location and Main Connector</h3>
<p>Here's a relative diagram of components location, that is necessary for explaining what Main Connector is. Click it for larger
version.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-08-11-design-v1/component-locations.jpg" title="Key component locations" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-08-11-design-v1/component-locations-thumb.jpg" title="Key component locations" alt="Key component locations" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Key component locations</p><p>Note that logically, the way one would wire this airplane would be to pre-wire switches and other items that go into the
pilot's (back) instrument panel with long pigtails, then install the switches, and tie down wiring behind the panel. Then,
the pigtails can be connected to fuse block and loads.</p>
<p>Some of the load wires already exist (lighting for example), and they will have to be spliced to wires coming from switches.</p>
<p>I have decided instead to locate a kind of &quot;Main Connector&quot;  right there near the Fuse
Block. A wire comes off of the Fuse Block, goes to the switch on the panel, then switched power
is returned to the &quot;Main Connector&quot;. Load is on the other side of Main Connector.</p>
<p>This serves a couple purposes:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Create a logical &quot;access point&quot; into the main wire bundle, for reading labels, tracing wires later, and such</li>
<li>Simplify installation process</li>
<li>Connect to existing load wires that are not being replaced</li>
</ul>
<p>For now, I am thinking about using Molex 0.093 pins in two housings (I have 13 circuits total to connect via this thing,
and want to have room for further expansion). I would love suggestions here. One of the requirements is that it should be
easily workable with a multimeter for tracing / testing purposes (I technically could've used  D-Sub here , but am
not due to this precise reason).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="separate-switch-for-turn-and-bank">
<h3>Separate Switch for Turn and Bank</h3>
<p>Yes, it's weird to have that. The original electrical had it. I guess, the logic was to be able to shed half an amp
of unnecessary load in the event of alternator failure, or it was just done for no good reason.</p>
<p>I'm keeping it :).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="front-panel-tach">
<h3>Front Panel Tach</h3>
<p>It's a <a class="reference external" href="http://www.westach.com/instructions/Y2AT3-2.jpg">Westach gauge</a> that feeds off of a magneto P-Lead.
No separate power going to it.</p>
<p>Westach asks for a 1/4 A inline fuse. But why? Seems unnecessary (we don't need to fuse P-Leads).</p>
<p>Wire going to this tach in my opinion need to be shielded P-Lead wire. Not sure if I'm correct here.</p>
<p>I need to tie into one of the P-Leads. I have three options:</p>
<p><strong>At magneto</strong>: I will effectively have two P-Leads coming off of one of them. I have Bendix mags, and connectors on those
might make the whole hookup look ugly. Adds extra wire.</p>
<p><strong>At mag switch in the rear panel</strong>: just adds extra ~4 feet of wire for no reason.</p>
<p><strong>Y-Split the P-lead as it goes along the fuselage</strong>: this seems the most optimal wire-management wise, but I am not sure if
splicing into a P-lead is kosher. I don't see any good reasons why that would be bad, but I don't know everything.
This will likely be a soldered splice unless I find or someone suggests something better. This is my solution of choice at the
moment.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="panel-lighting">
<h3>Panel Lighting</h3>
<p>I am on the fence on this one. On one hand, I can add a nice LED strip light and dimmer to light the panel up.</p>
<p>On the other hand, this is extra weight, and &quot;this is a biplane! you won't fly it at night!&quot; vs. &quot;well what if you find
yourself out late&quot; keeps nagging me. Note: I do <em>not</em> have a landing light (though in a biplane... that's somewhat
a non-necessity ;) ).</p>
<p>I am leaning towards doing it, because doing it now will be easy, and I will have the option to see my gauges at night, even
if that Dark and Stormy Night will be a result of bad planning rather than an intentional thing.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="awg-feeder-for-radios">
<h3>10 AWG Feeder for Radios</h3>
<p>Radio stack was wired via the &quot;Radio Master&quot; switch prior. I was initially going to run separate power feeds to each of the
things in the radio stack, but to get to it, I'll need to pull the wings off (yeah...). It's in between pilot's legs attached
to the bottom of the cockpit.</p>
<p>So, the feeder is staying. The stack has been wired by previous owner recently, and isn't wired badly - with individual fuses
for each radio, and a 10 AWG feeder to it and ground &quot;return&quot; from it.</p>
<p>I'm just putting this &quot;hose&quot; on a 30A fuse, which is more than enough to protect the wire and support all the loads from that
stack.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="strobe-and-nav-on-the-same-circuit">
<h3>Strobe and Nav on the Same Circuit</h3>
<p>I am replacing (TailNav, WingNav) + (old heavy strobe on belly) with <a class="reference external" href="https://uavionix.com/products/skybeacon/">SkyBeacon</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://uavionix.com/products/skysensor/">SkySensor</a> on wingtips and nav/strobe on the tail, but I don't have enough
wiring in the fuselage and wings to have a separate circuit for  strobes. I do not plan to fly IFR (biplane!) so &quot;strobes in
the clouds&quot; is not really an issue. When I will have the rag off the airplane, I will add a separate switching circuit
for just the strobes.</p>

go somewhere else, too.</p>
<p>By the way, the old voltage regulator in all it's glory:</p>

<hr class="dashed"/><p>Finally, doing some actual work on the airplane, and having fun! And I decided to start logging time.. because, why not!</p>
<div class="section" id="wire-marking">
<h2>Wire Marking</h2>
<p>I like marked wires. I used to be a networking guy, and I was very meticulous about marking every single wire in my cabinets, so that I knew
exactly what was plugged in where.</p>
<p>It took a bit of upfront time, but saved a bunch of it later on.</p>
<p>So naturally, I was planning to do the same on the Charger, and, more importantly, make it look <em>professional</em>.</p>
<p>Thanks to living in this day and age, that is simple. No, I'm not gonna pay someone to laser etch my wires - that's a cop out :). It's like
paying someone to paint your plane.</p>
<p>Instead, I have researched and found a perfect label maker - Brady BMP21 (not including a link here because it will probably go dead after
some time... just search for it). This thing has 3:1 heatshrink tube cartridges.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Shrunk!</p></div>
<div class="section" id="fusible-links">
<h2>Fusible Links</h2>
<p>Every wire must be fused at the source. Well, almost every :). We don't fuse a couple wires like battery - master contactor: but this is
an exception rather than the rule.</p>
<p>Most wires are fused on the fuse block at the main buss. But some wires are impractical or impossible to have hooked up to that. Think ammeter
shunt wires as a classic example.</p>
<p>For those, most people use bulky, ugly, and generally eww-y inline fuses. But there's a better option! Enter fusible links.</p>
<p>The idea is simple: use a short length of wire 4 gauges smaller the wire to be fused. So if your wire to be fused is 20AWG, you would do:</p>
<p>Source -&gt; 24AWG -&gt; 20AWG where the 24AWG segment acts as a fuse. The idea is, in case of a short, that piece will burn first.</p>
<p>So, I wanted to convince myself that that will work fine for me.</p>
<p>Initially, me and my ham neighbor tried to use his ~30 amp power supply to do it. No joy. The best we could do is 22 amps, and (imagine that!) 24
gauge we were trying to burn held up to the abuse with no sweat at all! I could even hold it in my fingers. Yay, milspec wire!</p>
<p>So I decided to go rough. I do have a discarded old  battery, after all. It was time to burn some wires with it.</p>
<p>Here, the red wire is 20AWG, and the black wire is 24AWG. Using crimps for quick setup.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Boom!</p><p>It burnt real quick, in less than a second, and the protected (red) wire barely got hot (I was holding it - that was a part of the test). Yes, say
that I am unscientific all you want - milspec wire holds up to 150C, and I can't hold up to 150C. The 20GA wire got barely warm - which means it
won't cause any problems in a bundle.</p>
<p>It worked!</p>
<p>Now, it was time to set up a real one - to make sure that when the &quot;fuse&quot; wire burns, it doesn't damage anything.</p>
<p>B&amp;C sells very nice fiberglass tubing covered in silicone for exactly this purpose.</p>
<p>I also soldered the fuselink in this time - I wanted to see how well will the solder splices hold to the temps.</p>

sleeve will go over it.</p>

the continuity wasn't there - it wasn't!!! Wow. The fiberglass sleeve contained the micro-explosion really well.</p>
<p>I took it off to inspect.</p>

<p>Great success!</p>
<p>I will need to play with different sizes of heatshrink and probably will use the glue lined strain relief kind just to support everything well, but
hey - this worked very well indeed!</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="load-measurements">
<h2>Load Measurements</h2>
<p>Prior to ripping the old wiring out, I wanted to take some real life load measurements with various things turned on,
so that I don't get any nasty surprises.</p>
<p>But this plane has no ammeter... damn. I searched around, and found this little doodad:</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-06-18-fuselinks/hamm.jpg" title="Hall Effect ammeter" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-06-18-fuselinks/hamm-thumb.jpg" title="Hall Effect ammeter" alt="Hall Effect ammeter" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Hall Effect ammeter</p><p>Very nice. It basically measures current on the wire passing thru this big white ring using Hall effect. Very cool! No need to splice into
the battery leads and install a temp shunt.</p>
<p>So, I rigged it up and took some numbers.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-06-18-fuselinks/amm-1.jpg" title="Rigged up" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-06-18-fuselinks/amm-1-thumb.jpg" title="Rigged up" alt="Rigged up" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Rigged up</p><ul class="simple">
<li>Master On: 1.5 amps<ul>
<li>Includes: Master Solenoid, and a couple of gauges</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Fuel Pump: 0.2 amps</li>
<li>&quot;Radios&quot; switch (turns on engine monitor, and power to radios: turning backlighting on them): 0.8 amps</li>
<li>I-Com Radio, Transmit: 2.6 amps</li>
<li>Intercom: 0.1 amps</li>
<li>Transponder: 1.1 amps</li>
<li>Smoke Oil pump: 2.2 - 2.6 amps (high on startup)</li>
</ul>
<p>So couple interesting things here. I think the x-der number is too low, but it wasn't being interrogated, and I can't make it be interrogated
without flying the plane or using a transponder tester which I don't have. Also, Master On is too high seemingly...
Will need to double check later and isolate things (master solenoid, hobbs, voltmeter, voltage regulator, fuel gauge) if I care enough - I don't
think I do. Also, fuel pump is too low seemingly. Need to double-check the spec.</p>
<p>And then, I could not turn on the Turn-Slip Indicator...</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="turn-slip-indicator">
<h2>Turn-Slip Indicator</h2>
<p>Sad, sad indicator... see, it's <em>long</em>. And it's wire connector is sticking out. And it's right behind the front seat's headrest, and there's
just not enough room for it, and the connector.</p>
<p>So whomever put it in... did this:</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-06-18-fuselinks/ts-1.jpg" title="Sad, sad wiring" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-06-18-fuselinks/ts-1-thumb.jpg" title="Sad, sad wiring" alt="Sad, sad wiring" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Sad, sad wiring</p><p>It's hard to see; but basically, those wires are bent &quot;down&quot; at a very sharp 90 degrees angle. Notice how he just used pins without the
actual connector. The distance between them is tiny! I am surprised they haven't shorted over all these years. I really am.</p>
<p>Initially, I thought the gauge didn't turn on because that wiring was all bust up, so to test it, I decided to pull it out.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-06-18-fuselinks/ts-2.jpg" title="On the bench" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-06-18-fuselinks/ts-2-thumb.jpg" title="On the bench" alt="On the bench" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">On the bench</p><p>I cut off the wires with those pins on them to hook it up to my testing battery... hmm.. but I needed some leads! Well, I was gonna
make a bunch of various test leads - so this is as good a time as any! Man, I love soldering...</p>
<p>I long decided to make a bunch of leads with &quot;passthru&quot; banana plugs on one end, and something (a crocodile clamp, a battery clamp,
a ring terminal) on the other. This way, I could mix and match, and plug them into my multimeter; daisy chain, and have multiples
depending on what and how I needed to hook up. I had all the bits (clamps, crocodiles, banana plugs), and even got a roll of very nice super
flexible silicone coated probe wire.</p>

<p>But I had resistance between + and -. And I had voltage! Hmmm..</p>
<p>Second time I hooked it up, I saw a bit of a spark when I put the positive clamp to the battery, and heard something.</p>
<p>I spun the gyro with my finger.... it spun up!</p>
<p>Well, well. So that gyro &quot;froze&quot; in a bit... Yep, it was hard to turn over with a finger - no doubt a small motor in there had a hard time!</p>
<p>I probably &quot;cleared it up&quot; a bit when turning it over with my fingers - but that won't last long... damn.</p>
<p>Are we looking at the overhaul for this thing too now? Sigh.... Maybe I can find parts
to do that myself, but not so sure about that.... It's not common for owners to overhaul their instruments - they're precision clockwork, after
all...</p>
<p>Oh well.</p>
<p>And I will have to figure out how to solve that wiring problem with no space to hook up the right type connector. I am thinking along the
lines of maybe routing a wire from inside of the gauge down thru a hole I'd drill, a grommet it it, and covering the whole business with
with some sealant or something, so that the dust doesn't get in. we'll see. Need to ponder this a bit more.</p>

<hr class="dashed"/><p>This thing nagged me for a while. The Charger did not have the Field breaker.
For that matter, it didn't have the Alternator master breaker, either.</p>
<p>It had this weird &quot;main buss&quot; breaker for 60 amps, but that didn't look
like the Alternator breaker to me.</p>
<p>So in between dealing with other things after having decided to
put her thru <a class="reference external" href="/category/chickenhouse-charger2019-annual.html">Annual in 2019</a>
a bit early, I was running around with my multimeter, tracing wires.</p>
<p>Initially, I quickly discovered that some lines were definitely not fused;
like Battery -&gt; Main Buss line, and thought I'd put inline fuses
into them, and be done.</p>
<p>She has an old charging system; a <em>mechanical</em> switching voltage regulator, and
a Delco Remy alternator seemingly from a tractor:</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">The old Delco-Remy</p><p>Voltage regulator didn't make sense. It had 4 wires (should be 2: supply and
field output, or 3: supply, sense, and field output).</p>
<p>Alternator didn't make sense. Instead of 1 wire for Field input, it had
two wires.</p>
<p>Additionally, Battery Contactor didn't make sense. One terminal had a wire
going to it. The other was grounded....</p>
<div class="section" id="interlude">
<h2>Interlude</h2>
<p>Battery Contactor is an interesting point here. Normally, one terminal
is connected to the &quot;always hot&quot; side of it (basically, directly to the battery)
and the other goes to the Master Switch. Master Switch turns the Battery
Contactor on by grounding that wire, providing the negative side to the circuit.
It's a safety thing. If that wire breaks, it'll either turn the electrical off
(open circuit), or it will keep it turned on (short to ground). That's it.</p>
<p>But, one of the terminals on the Battery Contactor was grounded... that means,
that the other terminal (the wire coming from the Master Switch) must provide
positive side??? Huh? But where does it get it's power <em>from</em>?</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="tracing">
<h2>Tracing</h2>
<p>So to tracing we went. I spend maybe 10 hours trying to find diagrams
and understand that alternator and voltage regulator hookups.</p>
<p>And me tracing it spelled my doom.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-diagram">
<h2>The Diagram</h2>
<p>Now, I didn't trace the rest of it. Just the main distribution system. That was
enough.</p>
<p>Shall we?</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-05-16-fire-hazard/fh-2.jpg" title="The current  main power system of the Charger" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-05-16-fire-hazard/fh-2-thumb.jpg" title="The current  main power system of the Charger" alt="The current  main power system of the Charger" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">The current  main power system of the Charger</p><p>Yep, the diagram is missing the main power buss. It's dangling off of the
same spot where everything else that's interesting is - the
Battery Contactor (marked MA RELAY) &lt;-&gt; Starter Contactor (marked STARTER REL)
link.</p>
<p>So let's see what we have here.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Lots of unfused wires. Do you see a <em>single</em> fuse here? Nope. That's because there aren't any. All the fuses are further downstream, off of the main buss.</li>
<li>Voltage Regulator has this extra wire running to / from cockpit that isn't really necessary and could've been kept on the hot side of the firewall (terminal 4 wire)</li>
<li>Alternator field broken at <em>output</em> (F-&gt;ALT) rather than at <em>input</em> (battery -&gt; terminal 3)</li>
<li>And the best part? <strong>Always hot wire that you can't turn off</strong> between the battery and the Master Switch to turn the Master Solenoid on.</li>
</ul>
<p>That last bit bugged me. I couldn't <em>find</em> the damn thing. Even before
actually tracing it, I knew that if the Master Solenoid is switched on the &quot;hot&quot;
side, it needs to get the power from somewhere, and that only could be battery. But I didn't see <em>any</em> wires on the always hot side of the Master Solenoid.
Only when I traced it, I actually traced the physical wire to where it goes, and
then found it. It was so tucked behind the battery -&gt; Master Solenoid wire that
it was invisible:</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">This little !@#!S@#....</p><p>Oh; and by the way, the Master Switch is the only switch that's <em>soldered</em> in,
and w/o any good insulation around the terminals, and over-stripped wires.
So that's just waiting to short, and the magic smoke that'll be let out
behind the panel when that shorts can't be stopped (always hot wire, remember?)</p>

<div class="section" id="the-wires">
<h2>The Wires</h2>
<p>So I kinda went backwards here; but I thought it'd be easier to see the
diagram first.</p>
<p>Let's see.</p>
<p>Most of connections are made on this very nicely marked terminal block:</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-05-16-fire-hazard/fh-4.jpg" title="The terminal block" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-05-16-fire-hazard/fh-4-thumb.jpg" title="The terminal block" alt="The terminal block" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">The terminal block</p><p>All the switched power comes out there, and every wire is marked. This
actually helped a lot in tracing. This block is on the side of the plane,
right next to the front hole's backrest.</p>
<p>You know what threw me off the most with that damned always hot wire
(I ended up tracing it <em>physically</em>)? It's how it's hooked up.</p>
<p>Yep, it is hooked up to that terminal block. To the terminal... that is
marked.. (drumroll).... &quot;Master Switch&quot;.</p>
<p>Wait.. this actually makes sense... But where's the &quot;return&quot; from the switch?</p>
<p>Ah! It's the wire that's marked.... drumroll... &quot;Fuel Gauge&quot;!</p>
<p>So really, let's look at what's going on, shall we? Zoom in the image below, it's annotated.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-05-16-fire-hazard/fh-explained.jpg" title="Untangled" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-05-16-fire-hazard/fh-explained-thumb.jpg" title="Untangled" alt="Untangled" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Untangled</p><p>So let's see. We've got this bundle of wires, a lot of which are not fused,
and one of which is always hot.</p>
<p>The Main Buss wire is the thickest one (10 gauge maybe?) that's not fused
between this buss bar and the source (engine compartment).</p>
<p>Oh, did I mention that this buss bar is on the side of the plane near the
rear instrument panel (so that 10 gauge run, and the rest of the harness
between firewall and the panel is about 30 inches long)?</p>
<p>What else do we see there? Oh! The two little 1/16inch thick aluminum lines
carrying.. fuel pressure (and oil pressure).</p>
<p>Shall I say more?</p>
<p>Shall I say that there's a fuel tank in between the front hole (passenger) and
the firewall?</p>
<p>That the wires run along between firewall and rear cockpit along that fuel
pressure line (to fuel pressure gauge)?</p>
<p>That if one shorts to this very nearby fuel pressure line, it'll burn a hole
straight thru it, and then ignite the gas that'll start coming out?</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>Can I fix all of that?</p>
<p>Sure. But rewiring will be much much easier, because I have to touch pretty much
everything. Re-running half of individual wires in a bundle is much harder than
re-running them all.</p>
<p>So, I made a decision to rewire the plane... Sigh. Looks like I won't be
flying for a looooong time.</p>
<p>Oh, and tell you what. Tracing wires on a biplane is dangerous. I ended up twisting my knee and pulling a muscle while trying to get behind the panel so badly that I couldn't walk (or sit) for 2.5 days :(.</p>
