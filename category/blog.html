<hr class="dashed"/><p>I've had a problem.</p>
<p>Well, two problems to be precise.</p>
<p>Problem number one: being an <em>alien</em> Texan, I had to ensure that I stay on the good side of our local BBQ police. Did you know
that if you move to Texas, you get deported if you can't pull off a passable brisket on an offset stick burner? You probably didn't!</p>
<p>My other problem was 20 inches wide, 40 inches long, and had a 3&quot; stack.</p>

   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2020-03-21-mean-beast/s-2-thumb.jpg" title="My Other Problem" alt="My Other Problem" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">My Other Problem</p><p>It was too small, which resulted in inability to make more than one brisket...</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2020-03-21-mean-beast/s-1.jpg" title="Loaded to the brim" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2020-03-21-mean-beast/s-1-thumb.jpg" title="Loaded to the brim" alt="Loaded to the brim" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Loaded to the brim</p><p>That's one brisket and some ribs - and they all are in suboptimal spots on the pit. It's just too small!</p>
<p>My son's fourth birthday I had to admit defeat and get a couple cooked briskets at <a class="reference external" href="https://www.brettsbackyardbarbque.com/">Brett's Backyard BBQ</a>. Nothing wrong with Brett - his briskets are grand; but <strong>I</strong> need to cook for my son's birthday!</p>
<p>On top of that, that pit was all choked up, with such a small stack that it couldn't handle any real size firewood. I ended up having
to fiddle with the fire every 10-15 minutes, and feed it with kindling.</p>
<p>So, after going thru all the smoking for New Years;  I decided that I outgrew my pit, and had to upgrade.</p>
<p>The usual suspects - <a class="reference external" href="https://bbqpits.com/">Klose</a>, <a class="reference external" href="gatorpit.net/">Gator</a>, and <a class="reference external" href="https://pitsbyjj.com/">JJ</a> were all on the list.
They're all in Houston, and I was gonna make a trip on January 2nd, and talk to each one of them. I was thinking about 24x48, and possibly
talking about getting a 30x48.</p>
<p>I considered a <a class="reference external" href="https://www.langbbqsmokers.com/">Lang</a> for a while; but decided against it - I kinda like the simplicity and
basic-ness, if you will, of a straight pit.</p>
<p>And in parallel, I was browsing Craigslist. Hey, if someone was dumping a good sized pit, I would've taken it off their hands.</p>
<p>And that's how I found...</p>
<div class="section" id="tim">
<h2>Tim</h2>
<p>There was a pit for sale that looked basic; but was everything I needed, and for just 1800 bucks. A lot? Well, a 20x40 Klose sells for
more, and this one was 24x60, I think; and <em>on a trailer</em>. It was.. dirt cheap.</p>
<p>It seemed that the guy selling it was in the business of making them. <a class="reference external" href="http://georgetownbbqpits.weebly.com/">He had a website</a>, and there
he said that he can custom build. Hmmmmm... I gave him a call.</p>
<p>... we met the same day. Mr. Tim turned out to be a rancher, welding pits up out of propane tanks as a side gig. &quot;Helps me feed the cows&quot;,
he said. They started as a group of buddies and helped each other make their pits; and then decided to make this into a paying side gig.</p>
<p>Tim's approach was simple and easy; and he was very open to tolerating my obnoxiousness and making a pit for me. We bounced ideas back
and forth, and none of those seemed to scare him too much.</p>
<p>That evening, I went home way over-excited, and started mocking things up ...</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-design">
<h2>The Design</h2>
<p>Just to make sure to illustrate what I wanted from Mr. Tim, I drew the key parts of the pit up in SWX and sent it over to him. We did a few
rounds of back and forth...</p>
<p>I wanted a baffle between the firebox and the cooking chamber that was adjustable from the outside; because I
felt like with that, I wouldn't need to tune it with tuning plates, which are much more annoying to deal with in a hot smoker (moving
them around in a hot smoker is no joke). I played with a baffle a lot on my old smoker, and wanted it easily adjustable on this one too.</p>

   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2020-03-21-mean-beast/baffle-thumb.jpg" title="Baffle" alt="Baffle" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Baffle</p><p>I wanted a &quot;Franklin Style Collector Stack&quot;. Like this:</p>

   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2020-03-21-mean-beast/pipe-thumb.jpg" title="Franklin Style Stack" alt="Franklin Style Stack" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Franklin Style Stack</p><p>I wanted a base on casters and leg levelers. See, I wanted it permanently installed - but I had to install it first; and a monster pit
is no joke weight-wise.</p>
<p>So the idea was, to have casters to move it around, and then remove the casters, and level it with leg levelers in place. So I designed
a funky base arrangement:</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Levelers and base detail</p><p>Mr. Tim was fine with all of those after asking some very pointed, and very good, questions, and offering a lot of suggestions and detail
and his take on things.</p>
<p>We settled on the final design, I put up the deposit, and Mr. Tim proceeded to ...</p>

<p>He took about 2 months, which, given that he's a one-man, part time, show, was blazing fast. He was feeding me a good diet of pictures :).</p>

and very sure, he inquired? I said, I thought it was beautiful!</p>
<p>At some point he said that it's <em>the wife</em> who needs to approve, and a wife would not generally approve of an old propane tank in
the backyard being an eyesore.</p>
<p>Well, my wife thought it looked great! :).</p>

all the funky geometry involved - but he offered! Of course!</p>

discussing options on how to hook it up.</p>
<p>He said, he might be ready in a week. I got very excited!</p>
<p>And then, exactly in a week,</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Off the trailer, now to turn and slide in...</p><p>We rolled it to it's final spot, raised one side, dug some holes in the dirt, and put pavers  down to have a solid footing for leg levelers.
Then, we took that side off the casters.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Setting up on pavers</p><p>The other side then got the same treatment. We used the levelers to level it then, and confirmed with running water inside the
cook chamber. It's very important to level the pit right, so that all the grease won't go into the firebox and light on fire!</p>
<p>Next morning, I took an angle grinder to the pit to knock some rust off.
Then, lots of soap, scrubbing, and hosing down. I hurt the day after BTW!</p>

<h2>The Fire!</h2>
<p>I oiled the firebox and lit a blaze to burn off all the bad smell.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Oil patina on the firebox</p><p>That yellow is no rust - it's oil burnt on. Kinda like a cast iron skillet.</p>
<p>I burnt the fire for as long as I could and as hot as I could.</p>
<p>Man, this pit drew! I could throw anything at it. 5-6 large logs? No problem! No choking. It just gets hotter and hotter! Man, what a
beast!</p>
<p>I kept her at about 450-500 for a few hours, and let it die down overnight.</p>
<p>The next morning, I washed the insides out of all the soot from the first fire, oiled the insides, and now went slowly. Now, it was the time
to season the insides with oil, and to do a quick check of temps.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2020-03-21-mean-beast/s-15.jpg" title="Oiled and pretty" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2020-03-21-mean-beast/s-15-thumb.jpg" title="Oiled and pretty" alt="Oiled and pretty" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Oiled and pretty</p><p>My TelTru gauges I've installed into 1/2 NPT ports we welded onto the pit in strategic places were dancing around a happy 250-275. The top
shelf in the middle was hotter with the baffle full open, but the pit evened out when I closed the baffle down a bit to deflect incoming
hot air from the firebox down. It worked! No tuning plates and I'm within 40ish degrees everywhere! Wow. Just.. wow.</p>
<p>I wanted to probe various parts of the pit closer to the firebox. I stuck in my thermocouple probe.... 350. What the hell? Too close?</p>
<p>I was messing around with it, with thermocouple showing me numbers that didn't agree with TelTrus at all. Finally, I did this test.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2020-03-21-mean-beast/s-14.jpg" title="Two probes" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2020-03-21-mean-beast/s-14-thumb.jpg" title="Two probes" alt="Two probes" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Two probes</p><p>The top is a TelTru mechanical gauge. The bottom is the thermocouple. They're within 1 inch of each other.
250 on the TelTru. 330 on the thermocouple. <em>At least one of them is lying</em>. But which one?</p>
<p>Hmm... how does one test a thermometer...? hmm.. aha! Boiling water! That's a nice reference.</p>
<p>Pulled all the 4 TelTrus and my thermocouple, and stuck them in the pot. All of then shown.. 212?! What the hell?</p>
<p>Weird cosmic rays affecting thermocouple crossed my mind, I admit. I talked with Ben. I talked with Alex, and Nick. No ideas.</p>
<p>Dammit!</p>
<p>I had a hunch then. Maybe, just <em>maybe</em>, the stick-out on the mechanical TelTru's was not long enough? To confirm, I did a couple things.</p>
<p>First of, I became somewhat of a aficionado of the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCselvHbb5ah0sEqZrFa-7nA">Mad Scientist BBQ</a> channel,
thru which I found out about <a class="reference external" href="https://fatstacksmokers.com/">Fat Stack Smokers</a>. I checked how long were their stems.
They used 4 inch TelTru's. I was using 2.5 inch ones.</p>
<p>Second, well.. I could confirm which gauge was lying by using paper thermometers - those little strips of paper with squares that turn
black in 10 degree increments.</p>
<p>I ordered some strips, and some 4 inch stemmed TelTru gauges - and meanwhile, decided to do another test - the biscuit check!</p>
<p>That's a fun one. You fire a pit, and fill it with frozen biscuits. You let them sit, and watch the rate at which they brown - to figure
out where the smoker's running hotter, and where it was colder.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2020-03-21-mean-beast/s-16.jpg" title="The Biscuit Test" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2020-03-21-mean-beast/s-16-thumb.jpg" title="The Biscuit Test" alt="The Biscuit Test" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">The Biscuit Test</p><p>With the baffle tuned to where I thought it'd be in the right spot, the test showed almost perfect results! The hottest spot was the middle
of the top shelf. The coldest was the middle shelf near the smokestack. Center middle and top near the smokestack were almost the same, and
all biscuits were reasonably evenly cooked - with crispier side to the firebox. That's the perfect offset distribution!</p>
<p>You see, brisket is thick on one end and thin on the other. The way I feel about it, you want one end to be hit by more heat than
the other. I actually like this temp gradient - if you have the smoker full, bigger pieces can go into hotter spots, and smaller pieces
can go into the colder ones; or you can rotate to cook everything roughly the same amount of time. I feel like that gives one more options
rather than an oven-like perfect environment. One of the reasons I didn't want a Lang BTW.</p>
<p>Those frozen biscuits turned out to taste like baking soda, by the way :(. Oh well. They were dirt cheap.</p>
<p>The following weekend, I set up the temp test with temp strips.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2020-03-21-mean-beast/s-17.jpg" title="The Temp Strips" >

 </a> <p class="small text-center">The results</p><p>330! So, it was the TelTru that was lying. My long-stem ones showed up, and I installed them to find perfect indication now.</p>

<hr class="dashed"/><p>Doing the <a class="reference external" href="/category/chickenhouse-chargerelectrical-rebuild.html">electrical rebuild on the Charger</a>, I needed
to terminate quite a few of heavy wires with large lug type Amp terminal rings.</p>
<p>I had a Harbor Freight hydraulic crimper lying around that I got to crimp a couple wires when I was
<a class="reference external" href="https://79ft.net/entries/cgr-30/">installing CRG-30P on the Cheetah</a>, and was planning on using it; though the type of crimps produced by it kinda bugged me.</p>
<p>After doing a few crimps, I decided to burn a few terminals and do a proper test.</p>
<div class="section" id="the-crimper">
<h2>The Crimper</h2>
<p>Normally, crimpers for large size terminals are super expensive; but Harbor Freight, as usual, sells
a hydraulic crimper with large dies for just about fifty bucks.</p>
<p>Here it is, in it's full glory.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-09-07-hf-crimper/crimper.jpg" title="Crimper" >

   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-09-07-hf-crimper/crimper-dies-thumb.jpg" title="Dies" alt="Dies" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Dies</p><p>Technically, the way it's designed is it's supposed to produce these nice hexagonal crimps. Or at least, I think that's
what they were trying to do.</p>
<p>But those familiar with crimpers know that the key is in good dies; and that's were most of the money is. Damn, &quot;regular&quot;
stripping dies for StripMaster are what, $10; while milspec dies are what, $150? Now; of course there's diminishing
returns there - in the case of StripMaster, regular dies work just fine for most applications.</p>
<p>Here's the problem with HF Crimper dies. The holes in them are severely <strong>undersized</strong>, which makes them produce &quot;flat&quot;,
rather than hexagonal crimps. We can't know if this is by design. What I tried to do is to research what others are doing,
and to run a few &quot;is this a good crimp&quot; tests.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-test-setup">
<h2>The Test Setup</h2>
<p>I was crimping chunks of 8 AWG MIL-W-22759/16 wire into AMP Battery Terminals.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">The Terminal</p><p>After crimping, the terminals were hacksawed in the middle of the crimp, and polished to see if there were any voids or
visible wire strands. A good crimp must be &quot;gas tight&quot;. In other words, all the metal has to be pushed together hard
enough to become a <em>single</em> piece of metal for all intents and purposes.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="using-8-awg-dies">
<h2>Using 8 AWG dies</h2>
<p>For baseline, I used the HF die marked for 8 AWG.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">8 AWG die / crimp</p><p>As you can see, using the &quot;nominal&quot; die produces this weird, flattish-with-a-bulge crimp. What's worse is it adds this
strange &quot;jog&quot; to the terminal lengthwise, and scrapes the metal inward where the crimp starts. That's lots of stress
risers.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">8 AWG die / cutaway</p><p>The crimp quality is good though. There are a few specks of shavings I didn't clean off - those are not defects.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="using-6-awg-dies">
<h2>Using 6 AWG Dies</h2>
<p>I went next size up, to dies marked for 6 AWG. That produced the same crimp as for 8 AWG, but with &quot;wings&quot; being thinner -
almost paper-thin. I also didn't like how it mangled the terminal even more.</p>
<p>Somebody online mentioned that they rotated the crimp 90 degrees and did it again to &quot;push the wings in&quot; and I tried that.</p>

<div class="section" id="using-4-awg-dies">
<h2>Using 4 AWG Dies</h2>
<p>Finally, I tried 4 AWG dies.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-09-07-hf-crimper/c-7.jpg" title="4 AWG die / crimp" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-09-07-hf-crimper/c-7-thumb.jpg" title="4 AWG die / crimp" alt="4 AWG die / crimp" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">4 AWG die / crimp</p><p>This crimp almost looks good. The jog is almost not there, and it has nice hexagonal shape. &quot;Wings&quot; are almost not present.</p>
<p>However, the dies closed fully and it felt to me that the metal was not compressed enough (I recall the resistance I felt
in the crimper doing the previous two tests, and the resistance I felt on this one was much less).</p>
<p>The cutaway confirmed that.</p>

   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-09-07-hf-crimper/c-8-thumb.jpg" title="4 AWG die / cutaway" alt="4 AWG die / cutaway" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">4 AWG die / cutaway</p><p>Those imperfections on the cutaway are voids left from not enough compression force applied.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="conclusion">
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Well, it's a sad one really. If you want to use the HF tool, then you probably should use dies that make those &quot;winged&quot;
style crimps (like the one produced in my first test), and suck up the jog and other imperfections.</p>
<p>I have posted my findings on AeroElectric list, and the conclusions seems to be supported - the dies are horrible, and to
make them real good one would need to rework them significantly.</p>

<p>Or, alternatively, just solder them (<a class="reference external" href="/files/aeroelectric/big_term.pdf">here's a nice howto by Mr. Nuckolls</a>) ,
which is what I am seriously considering.</p>

<div class="section" id="update-october-2019">
<h2>Update - October 2019</h2>
<p>After <a class="reference external" href="https://79ft.net/entries/2019-10-08-good-crimps/">trying and failing the soldering approach</a>, I have devised a technique of using this crimper to achieve
good results. Musings linked in the previous sentence, and here's the jist:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Given wire gauge of, say, 6</li>
<li>Use die 2 sizes up - so, die marked for #2 wire</li>
<li>Put the wire in the terminal. Start by squeezing the terminal turned 90 degrees (so &quot;side to side&quot; rather then &quot;top to bottom&quot;). Just give it a gentle oval shape</li>
<li>Now, turn it 90 degrees and squeeze until the jaws close</li>
<li>At this point, you will have a somewhat <em>undercrimped</em> joint, as I described in my notes on the crimper; but it's shape will be a perfect hex.</li>
<li>Now, go 1 size &quot;down&quot; (so, dies marked for #4 wire). Squeeze.</li>
<li>Stop when you feel it's done shrinking.</li>
</ul>

<hr class="dashed"/><p>No posts for 1 month and 5 days! Holy cow.</p>
<p>That's all been eaten up by a couple projects. One of them ended up being a complete redraw of all airfoil sections on the lower wings on the Skybolt; and nothing to write about (no pretty pictures, very routine work). Just lots and lots of cleanup.</p>
<p>Another one... was me following an old Russian tradition.</p>
<p>You see, during long winter months Russians' desire for fruit and vegetables (and mushrooms) is satisfied with pickled everything. Cucumbers, tomatoes, cabbage, grape leaves, dill (!), apples, garlic, fish (haha :) ), and other things which I don't know English words for.</p>
<p>My genes are calling. It's fall, and I had to pickle me something.</p>
<p>It was.. a disassembled Lycoming for the Skybolt!</p>
<p>Some weeks ago, a gentleman posted on the Forum about him selling an O-360-A4M, all overhauled, yellowtagged, and such, by Superior; with higher compression pistons from ECI, with everything needed to put it together minus the sump and accessories, for a very attractive price.</p>
<p>Best part was, it was disassembled, so I am to get all the fun putting it together without the disassembling and sending parts out for overhaul (and well, paying for that too :)).</p>
<p>In short, it was a great deal.</p>
<p>The problem? Well, I will not need it for quite a while. 10 years maybe, if I go with the speed I'm currently going at.</p>
<p>I figured, assembling and pickling it after would be a bad proposition. A much better one would be to pickle it part by part.</p>
<p>As usual, started with a <a class="reference external" href="http://www.biplaneforum.com/showthread.php?t=10628">thread on the Biplane Forum</a>.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, I ended up using three things.</p>

<p>It sprays on, and then dries over a couple days to consistency of candlewax. A bit sticky, but very tough. They claim it's scratch resistant.</p>
<p>Just in case I missed something or ended up scratching it off; I decided to also put a thick layer of Aeroshell grease on everything that's covered with CorrShield. Just in case.</p>

<hr class="dashed"/><p>I decided not to post current progress on the aileron linkage.. Too much work
into it, and too little to show. It was mostly cleanups, and modeling a few
missing pushrods. Still need to put more things up until there's anything to
talk about.</p>
<p>So instead, I present you...</p>

<h2>The Rant</h2>
<p>Originally posted as a reply to a hundred (or so) year old question of  &quot;why&quot;
in <a class="reference external" href="http://www.biplaneforum.com/showthread.php?t=10205">yet-another-thread-on-the-topic on the Forum</a>.</p>
<p>Me and Ben; both Grumman fans and AA5-B aficionados, are sitting in a $100
burger place called Props at Ben's home field, chatting hangar talk.
A really slick taildragger pulls up to the pump. &quot;Oh; that's an RV-8.
It's a homebuilt&quot; - says Ben.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/rant-1-july-2014/rv-8.jpg" title="One of RV-8s based in Watsonville" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/rant-1-july-2014/rv-8-thumb.jpg" title="One of RV-8s based in Watsonville" alt="One of RV-8s based in Watsonville" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">One of RV-8s based in Watsonville</p><p>I've heard about that some crazyfolk build planes in their garages
before, but, being a fresh-off-the-rolls pilot with ~3 months of ticket
behind me, never given it thought. My very first instructor's primary words
were 'follow the procedure, checklist, certification, standards'
(sidenote: I am not against following procedures, Im against
instruction-without-explanation-of-why). Glad I ditched that guy 1/2 into my
training... But you get the gist.</p>
<p>So, back to RVs. What a beautiful machine! Looks almost like a Grumman..
but slicker, newer, cleaner... And it's easy to build! And .. and ... and.</p>
<p>That times, I didn't have much background building stuff. I built some
simple furniture with hand tools (think circular saw and trim router). I did
some stuff in my mom's house back in Russia, primarily designing and building electrics and plumbing, when I was a teenager. I built office networks
(15 1-inch holes in 3ft thick brick walls, anyone?  Russian buildings are BIIG).
I never really truly fabricated anything... Building computers was another
one, but that one didn't involve any fabrication either, just making sure you
put a cable right side in (anyone remember AT-style motherboard power
connectors?  &quot;Black-To-Black&quot;, I will never forget ).</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/rant-1-july-2014/cable-guy.jpg" title="My experience level..." >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/rant-1-july-2014/cable-guy-thumb.jpg" title="My experience level..." alt="My experience level..." >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">My experience level...</p><p>But I was always into tinkering with stuff.</p>
<p>So anyway, the whole idea of building a plane didn't scare me, and I was
excited, but I wanted something with lots'a support, good kit, and such -
because the idea of <em>fabricating</em> stuff scared me, at least somewhat. I also
wanted something fast. The plan was, we move out of state (I was in CA back
then, and that's the whole other story), I sell my share in my Tiger, add
money, and build an RV. I really wanted an 8; but ended up deciding on a 10,
because I like having more than one victim in my plane every now and then.</p>

   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/rant-1-july-2014/rv-10-thumb.jpg" title="My dream plane.. back then." alt="My dream plane.. back then." >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">My dream plane.. back then.</p><p>I just wanted a Grumman Tiger, Improved; costs wouldn't allow me to get
and some other things repulsed me from Cirrus, Columbia, and a-likes.</p>
<p>I was on Van's forums, reading technical details, articles, and such.</p>
<p>I was studying intricacies of how to connect Dynons with a 430 and make it
a certifiable IFR EFIS with GPS. I was almost about to start my IFR ticket
training, BTW.</p>
<p>I was dead set.</p>
<p>And then, that same Ben got me a ride in a Stearman with his buddy Jerry.
That guy never ever flew a nosewheel, BTW; that day I caught Ben convincing
Jerry that he has to get in Ben's Tiger and learn nosewheel finally
(&quot;yeah.. it's the same as a Stearman.. just never wheel it!&quot; - Ben was
sagely saying to Jerry at Props), and then Ben went &quot;Oh Fidot, that's great
you're here - we gotta put you in a Stearman&quot;. And they did.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/rant-1-july-2014/stearman.jpg" title="That Stearman" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/rant-1-july-2014/stearman-thumb.jpg" title="That Stearman" alt="That Stearman" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">That Stearman</p><p>That day, in that first loop on the top side, my world was upside down, quite
literally. I did IFR before; Drew, my second instructor, was a professional
torturer (and great one at it; Im yet to see an instructor that comes even
close to Drew). He made me do DME arks and shoot ILS approaches as a part of
my VFR training, Because He Could (and we got that nasty marine layer in
Oakland every now and then). I never did acro; not even spins though.</p>
<p>But That Loop... that was something completely out of a different world.
The difference between never flying an airplane and flying a ratty Cessna 172
for the first time during the misleadingly cheap &quot;demo flight&quot; was probably
less than the difference between having ~150 hours in nosepushers as a
'Private Pilot, ASEL', and doing a loop in a Stearman.</p>
<p>That caused a lot of thinking; a bunch of reading; and a ton of soul-searching.</p>
<p>As a result, my IFR money went into basic acro training (that I couldn't
finish because I ended up moving out of state, after all, and there's no
good acro schools around where I am right now).</p>
<p>As a result, RV-10 that flies dozens of pounds of electronics was ditched
for a biplane. And open cockpit. And a 2 seater ('cause I like victims!!).</p>
<p>And most importantly, came a realization. You have to build an airplane to
experience building an airplane. You can't build one 'cause you want one cheap,
or you just Want One. Man, you can pick up an oldish Cub or a Citabria for
about 30 grand; and a Yankee for about 25. Hell, you can pick up the homebuilt
you want for less money than it's gonna cost you to build, if you're patient
enough (and even if you have to wait for a year for one to pop up, you will
still spend less time than putting together a kit (2-weeks-to-taxi et al
excluded)).</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/rant-1-july-2014/bolt.jpg" title="Yeah.. Ill build THAT instead." >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/rant-1-july-2014/bolt-thumb.jpg" title="Yeah.. Ill build THAT instead." alt="Yeah.. Ill build THAT instead." >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Yeah.. Ill build THAT instead.</p><p>And 'cause I wanted to build to Build, I had to do it the <em>right</em> way.
So, plans-built it was. I got the plans about a year and a half ago, and went
thru mood swings between 'damm this is awesome' and 'damm Ill not fly for
10 years or will have to buy components or cut corners'.</p>
<p>There was, and is, a problem, and a hard one for me. Im addicted to flying.
I did ~190 hours in the Tiger over a year and a half I owned that share in
before moving out of state.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/rant-1-july-2014/797.jpg" title="That Tiger; BTW..." >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/rant-1-july-2014/797-thumb.jpg" title="That Tiger; BTW..." alt="That Tiger; BTW..." >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">That Tiger; BTW...</p><p>But Im also addicted to building.</p>
<p>So I ended up deciding for myself that Im gonna do both. And I am.
And I couldn't be happier. I don't need That Plane Im Building right now,
I have something to fly. I decided not to rush, and just Take My Time; just
make sure to not take multi-month breaks. 10 years, whatever. Im not in a rush.</p>
<p>Plus, my thinking is that works our real well with $$. You don't have to
give tens of Ks of Presidents' Portraits to Vans or anyone else all at once.
You pay as you go, and you build as you go. Got a bonus? Put it aside for an
engine. Don't have one? Get some tubing and burn some holes in metal. Hey,
I bet you can get cutoffs for dirt cheap or free at you local metal yard or
whatever. Don't have any money? Do some reading, drawing, learning, and such.
Hell, learn mechanical engineering. Aerodynamics. Structural analysis.
3D CAD (that's my current gig ). Hang out and help other folk in your chapter
build things.</p>

<hr class="dashed"/><p>So, originally it was supposed to be the shop <em>day</em>. I was gonna clean and
put together the compressor I picked up off a gentleman on Craigslist, and set
up the air hoses, filters and such - and then, back to CAD. And then..</p>
<p>See, I was looking for a bandsaw. I wasn't in a rush, so I was
gonna pick up a good used one; so I was watching Craigslist and such,
waiting and waiting. After doing that for about 6 months and after I got
tired of not having one; I finally said &quot;screw it&quot; and bid on one on Ebay.</p>
<p>I won it on Friday around 4pm; paid, and went home. Well; there, in my
Gmail's Inbox, was a notification from
<a class="reference external" href="http://craigwatcher.com/">CraigWatcher</a> saying that yet another bandsaw
ad was posted... I opened it up; and couldn't believe my eyes.</p>
<p>Someone was selling.. an 18 inch Grizzly saw for 250 bucks! I couldn't pass
on it; and next morning was driving back with a 300 pound beast in the back
of my car....</p>
<p>... and then, spent a week and a half cleaning it up. I polished the rust out of
the table; changed some bearings, re-cut threads on the blade tensioning
rod, added a 4 inch dust port (for whatever weird reason, Grizzly decided
not to put a dust port on this particular model).</p>
<p>It also ran on the 220, so I had to add a 220 outlet to the shop... Decided to
go all out; and added a 6 gauge run with 50 amp breaker, so that I can run
a TIG welder off of it when I get one.</p>
<p>So now; I own two bandsaws :).</p>
<p>Here's the perpetrator:</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">The Bandsaw</p><p>Since we're talking shop....</p>
<p>Right now Im set up in the garage of the old house we bought about half a year
ago. Dash (my beautiful wife) is working on designing a new house we're gonna
build; and that one is going to have a good sized shop. We will build
that house first and then demo the old house; so I could start setting
up earlier than I thought I would be able to; which is certainly nice.</p>
<p>But; Im dealing with 40 year old electrical; and other fun stuff..</p>
<p>Here are some pictures of that garage, ordered historically, as I was setting
up.</p>

<p>Air setup is very simple, a compressor with a shutoff directly into an air
filter, regulator, and 25 feet of hose on a reel. That reaches pretty much
everywhere.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">The Air Setup (very simple for now)</p><p>At some point; I measured the runout on the drill press -- got around 10
thousandths - no wonder why it was all vibrating when drilling deep holes!</p>
<p>Grizzly includes very cheap chucks and arbors with their presses... Gladly,
the bearings have no play though. I ended up picking up a used Jacobs chuck
on Ebay, and boy, what a world of difference! Used a SouthBend arbor picked
up on Amazon.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">The Jacobs Chuck</p><p>I wanted a router table; but didn't want to pay around a grand for the one
I like (and cheap ones are just.. crap, honestly); so I built one.</p>
<p>Top is two sheets of 3/4 MDF, laminated together.  White Formica is laminated on
top, bottom, and sides. All done with DAP Weldwood contact cement.</p>
<p>I bought the insert plate (though in hindsight, I should've just bought
a hunk of aluminum and made it myself).</p>
<p>It still ended up being a bit out-of-flat, so I built a leveling system into
the base (two bolts on each side are pulling the top &quot;down&quot;, screwing into holes
in the top with threaded inserts; and there are two screws pushing up on the top
in the center of each long frame side. All that allows me to work out any
non-flatness out of the top.</p>
<p>Fence is 3/4 ply; and the router sits in the box under the table. The box
has 4 inch dust fitting epoxied on it on the other side (and the fence
dust collector feeds into that fitting too).</p>
