<hr class="dashed"/><p>No posts for 1 month and 5 days! Holy cow.</p>
<p>That's all been eaten up by a couple projects. One of them ended up being a complete redraw of all airfoil sections on the lower wings on the Skybolt; and nothing to write about (no pretty pictures, very routine work). Just lots and lots of cleanup.</p>
<p>Another one... was me following an old Russian tradition.</p>
<p>You see, during long winter months Russians' desire for fruit and vegetables (and mushrooms) is satisfied with pickled everything. Cucumbers, tomatoes, cabbage, grape leaves, dill (!), apples, garlic, fish (haha :) ), and other things which I don't know English words for.</p>
<p>My genes are calling. It's fall, and I had to pickle me something.</p>
<p>It was.. a disassembled Lycoming for the Skybolt!</p>
<p>Some weeks ago, a gentleman posted on the Forum about him selling an O-360-A4M, all overhauled, yellowtagged, and such, by Superior; with higher compression pistons from ECI, with everything needed to put it together minus the sump and accessories, for a very attractive price.</p>
<p>Best part was, it was disassembled, so I am to get all the fun putting it together without the disassembling and sending parts out for overhaul (and well, paying for that too :)).</p>
<p>In short, it was a great deal.</p>
<p>The problem? Well, I will not need it for quite a while. 10 years maybe, if I go with the speed I'm currently going at.</p>
<p>I figured, assembling and pickling it after would be a bad proposition. A much better one would be to pickle it part by part.</p>
<p>As usual, started with a <a class="reference external" href="http://www.biplaneforum.com/showthread.php?t=10628">thread on the Biplane Forum</a>.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, I ended up using three things.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Phillips Anti-Rust Oil</li>
<li>STP</li>
<li>Cortec CorrShield VpCI-368</li>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Cortec CorrShield VpCI-368</p><p>This latter substance is amazing. It's mineral spirits soluble, moisture displacing spray-on stuff that can protect up to 2 years in outside (!!!) storage. I'm storing the engine parts inside my house, so I figured it will do very good for a much bigger number of years.</p>
<p>It sprays on, and then dries over a couple days to consistency of candlewax. A bit sticky, but very tough. They claim it's scratch resistant.</p>
<p>Just in case I missed something or ended up scratching it off; I decided to also put a thick layer of Aeroshell grease on everything that's covered with CorrShield. Just in case.</p>
<p>And then...</p>

<h2>The Rant</h2>
<p>Originally posted as a reply to a hundred (or so) year old question of  &quot;why&quot;
in <a class="reference external" href="http://www.biplaneforum.com/showthread.php?t=10205">yet-another-thread-on-the-topic on the Forum</a>.</p>
<p>Me and Ben; both Grumman fans and AA5-B aficionados, are sitting in a $100
burger place called Props at Ben's home field, chatting hangar talk.
A really slick taildragger pulls up to the pump. &quot;Oh; that's an RV-8.
It's a homebuilt&quot; - says Ben.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/rant-1-july-2014/rv-8.jpg" title="One of RV-8s based in Watsonville" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/rant-1-july-2014/rv-8-thumb.jpg" title="One of RV-8s based in Watsonville" alt="One of RV-8s based in Watsonville" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">One of RV-8s based in Watsonville</p><p>I've heard about that some crazyfolk build planes in their garages
before, but, being a fresh-off-the-rolls pilot with ~3 months of ticket
behind me, never given it thought. My very first instructor's primary words
were 'follow the procedure, checklist, certification, standards'
(sidenote: I am not against following procedures, Im against
instruction-without-explanation-of-why). Glad I ditched that guy 1/2 into my
training... But you get the gist.</p>
<p>So, back to RVs. What a beautiful machine! Looks almost like a Grumman..
but slicker, newer, cleaner... And it's easy to build! And .. and ... and.</p>
<p>That times, I didn't have much background building stuff. I built some
simple furniture with hand tools (think circular saw and trim router). I did
some stuff in my mom's house back in Russia, primarily designing and building electrics and plumbing, when I was a teenager. I built office networks
(15 1-inch holes in 3ft thick brick walls, anyone?  Russian buildings are BIIG).
I never really truly fabricated anything... Building computers was another
one, but that one didn't involve any fabrication either, just making sure you
put a cable right side in (anyone remember AT-style motherboard power
connectors?  &quot;Black-To-Black&quot;, I will never forget ).</p>

   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/rant-1-july-2014/cable-guy-thumb.jpg" title="My experience level..." alt="My experience level..." >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">My experience level...</p><p>But I was always into tinkering with stuff.</p>
<p>So anyway, the whole idea of building a plane didn't scare me, and I was
excited, but I wanted something with lots'a support, good kit, and such -
because the idea of <em>fabricating</em> stuff scared me, at least somewhat. I also
wanted something fast. The plan was, we move out of state (I was in CA back
then, and that's the whole other story), I sell my share in my Tiger, add
money, and build an RV. I really wanted an 8; but ended up deciding on a 10,
because I like having more than one victim in my plane every now and then.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">My dream plane.. back then.</p><p>I just wanted a Grumman Tiger, Improved; costs wouldn't allow me to get
and some other things repulsed me from Cirrus, Columbia, and a-likes.</p>
<p>I was on Van's forums, reading technical details, articles, and such.</p>
<p>I was studying intricacies of how to connect Dynons with a 430 and make it
a certifiable IFR EFIS with GPS. I was almost about to start my IFR ticket
training, BTW.</p>
<p>I was dead set.</p>
<p>And then, that same Ben got me a ride in a Stearman with his buddy Jerry.
That guy never ever flew a nosewheel, BTW; that day I caught Ben convincing
Jerry that he has to get in Ben's Tiger and learn nosewheel finally
(&quot;yeah.. it's the same as a Stearman.. just never wheel it!&quot; - Ben was
sagely saying to Jerry at Props), and then Ben went &quot;Oh Fidot, that's great
you're here - we gotta put you in a Stearman&quot;. And they did.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/rant-1-july-2014/stearman.jpg" title="That Stearman" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/rant-1-july-2014/stearman-thumb.jpg" title="That Stearman" alt="That Stearman" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">That Stearman</p><p>That day, in that first loop on the top side, my world was upside down, quite
literally. I did IFR before; Drew, my second instructor, was a professional
torturer (and great one at it; Im yet to see an instructor that comes even
close to Drew). He made me do DME arks and shoot ILS approaches as a part of
my VFR training, Because He Could (and we got that nasty marine layer in
Oakland every now and then). I never did acro; not even spins though.</p>
<p>But That Loop... that was something completely out of a different world.
The difference between never flying an airplane and flying a ratty Cessna 172
for the first time during the misleadingly cheap &quot;demo flight&quot; was probably
less than the difference between having ~150 hours in nosepushers as a
'Private Pilot, ASEL', and doing a loop in a Stearman.</p>
<p>That caused a lot of thinking; a bunch of reading; and a ton of soul-searching.</p>
<p>As a result, my IFR money went into basic acro training (that I couldn't
finish because I ended up moving out of state, after all, and there's no
good acro schools around where I am right now).</p>
<p>As a result, RV-10 that flies dozens of pounds of electronics was ditched
for a biplane. And open cockpit. And a 2 seater ('cause I like victims!!).</p>
<p>And most importantly, came a realization. You have to build an airplane to
experience building an airplane. You can't build one 'cause you want one cheap,
or you just Want One. Man, you can pick up an oldish Cub or a Citabria for
about 30 grand; and a Yankee for about 25. Hell, you can pick up the homebuilt
you want for less money than it's gonna cost you to build, if you're patient
enough (and even if you have to wait for a year for one to pop up, you will
still spend less time than putting together a kit (2-weeks-to-taxi et al
excluded)).</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Yeah.. Ill build THAT instead.</p><p>And 'cause I wanted to build to Build, I had to do it the <em>right</em> way.
So, plans-built it was. I got the plans about a year and a half ago, and went
thru mood swings between 'damm this is awesome' and 'damm Ill not fly for
10 years or will have to buy components or cut corners'.</p>
<p>There was, and is, a problem, and a hard one for me. Im addicted to flying.
I did ~190 hours in the Tiger over a year and a half I owned that share in
before moving out of state.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/rant-1-july-2014/797.jpg" title="That Tiger; BTW..." >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/rant-1-july-2014/797-thumb.jpg" title="That Tiger; BTW..." alt="That Tiger; BTW..." >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">That Tiger; BTW...</p><p>But Im also addicted to building.</p>
<p>So I ended up deciding for myself that Im gonna do both. And I am.
And I couldn't be happier. I don't need That Plane Im Building right now,
I have something to fly. I decided not to rush, and just Take My Time; just
make sure to not take multi-month breaks. 10 years, whatever. Im not in a rush.</p>
<p>Plus, my thinking is that works our real well with $$. You don't have to
give tens of Ks of Presidents' Portraits to Vans or anyone else all at once.
You pay as you go, and you build as you go. Got a bonus? Put it aside for an
engine. Don't have one? Get some tubing and burn some holes in metal. Hey,
I bet you can get cutoffs for dirt cheap or free at you local metal yard or
whatever. Don't have any money? Do some reading, drawing, learning, and such.
Hell, learn mechanical engineering. Aerodynamics. Structural analysis.
3D CAD (that's my current gig ). Hang out and help other folk in your chapter
build things.</p>

<hr class="dashed"/><p>So, originally it was supposed to be the shop <em>day</em>. I was gonna clean and
put together the compressor I picked up off a gentleman on Craigslist, and set
up the air hoses, filters and such - and then, back to CAD. And then..</p>
<p>See, I was looking for a bandsaw. I wasn't in a rush, so I was
gonna pick up a good used one; so I was watching Craigslist and such,
waiting and waiting. After doing that for about 6 months and after I got
tired of not having one; I finally said &quot;screw it&quot; and bid on one on Ebay.</p>
<p>I won it on Friday around 4pm; paid, and went home. Well; there, in my
Gmail's Inbox, was a notification from
<a class="reference external" href="http://craigwatcher.com/">CraigWatcher</a> saying that yet another bandsaw
ad was posted... I opened it up; and couldn't believe my eyes.</p>
<p>Someone was selling.. an 18 inch Grizzly saw for 250 bucks! I couldn't pass
on it; and next morning was driving back with a 300 pound beast in the back
of my car....</p>
<p>... and then, spent a week and a half cleaning it up. I polished the rust out of
the table; changed some bearings, re-cut threads on the blade tensioning
rod, added a 4 inch dust port (for whatever weird reason, Grizzly decided
not to put a dust port on this particular model).</p>
<p>It also ran on the 220, so I had to add a 220 outlet to the shop... Decided to
go all out; and added a 6 gauge run with 50 amp breaker, so that I can run
a TIG welder off of it when I get one.</p>
<p>So now; I own two bandsaws :).</p>
<p>Here's the perpetrator:</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">The Bandsaw</p><p>Since we're talking shop....</p>
<p>Right now Im set up in the garage of the old house we bought about half a year
ago. Dash (my beautiful wife) is working on designing a new house we're gonna
build; and that one is going to have a good sized shop. We will build
that house first and then demo the old house; so I could start setting
up earlier than I thought I would be able to; which is certainly nice.</p>
<p>But; Im dealing with 40 year old electrical; and other fun stuff..</p>
<p>Here are some pictures of that garage, ordered historically, as I was setting
up.</p>

<p>Air setup is very simple, a compressor with a shutoff directly into an air
filter, regulator, and 25 feet of hose on a reel. That reaches pretty much
everywhere.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">The Air Setup (very simple for now)</p><p>At some point; I measured the runout on the drill press -- got around 10
thousandths - no wonder why it was all vibrating when drilling deep holes!</p>
<p>Grizzly includes very cheap chucks and arbors with their presses... Gladly,
the bearings have no play though. I ended up picking up a used Jacobs chuck
on Ebay, and boy, what a world of difference! Used a SouthBend arbor picked
up on Amazon.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/shop-june-2014/chuck.jpg" title="The Jacobs Chuck" >

 </a> <p class="small text-center">The Jacobs Chuck</p><p>I wanted a router table; but didn't want to pay around a grand for the one
I like (and cheap ones are just.. crap, honestly); so I built one.</p>
<p>Top is two sheets of 3/4 MDF, laminated together.  White Formica is laminated on
top, bottom, and sides. All done with DAP Weldwood contact cement.</p>
<p>I bought the insert plate (though in hindsight, I should've just bought
a hunk of aluminum and made it myself).</p>
<p>It still ended up being a bit out-of-flat, so I built a leveling system into
the base (two bolts on each side are pulling the top &quot;down&quot;, screwing into holes
in the top with threaded inserts; and there are two screws pushing up on the top
in the center of each long frame side. All that allows me to work out any
non-flatness out of the top.</p>
<p>Fence is 3/4 ply; and the router sits in the box under the table. The box
has 4 inch dust fitting epoxied on it on the other side (and the fence
dust collector feeds into that fitting too).</p>
