<h2>Trying to Get off Easily</h2>
<p>After <a class="reference external" href="http://79ft.net/entries/2020-02-23-xcers-brackets/">having mounted my transducers</a>,
it was time to hook'em up.</p>
<p>I also needed a new engine pump -&gt; carb hose, because the old one was too long.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2020-04-29-hosed/h-7.jpg" title="The old pump -> carb hose" >

 </a> <p class="small text-center">The old pump -> carb hose</p><p>And since I was dealing with hoses, I figured I'd clean up this monstrosity of the electric pump -&gt; engine pump hose.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2020-04-29-hosed/h-2.jpg" title="Ugly hose." >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2020-04-29-hosed/h-2-thumb.jpg" title="Ugly hose." alt="Ugly hose." >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Ugly hose.</p><p>There are a few options of course. Pre-fabbed hoses - you gotta measure carefully and they'll be made to the exact sizes you want.
You can buy fittings and make your own. You can go with different styles - integrated silicone firesleeve or &quot;crimp on&quot;, rubber
or teflon, yada yada.</p>
<p>I decided to go with pre-fabbed. I did the math a number of times; and a pre-fabbed hose was cheaper than making my own.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://www.tsflightlines.com/home.html">TS Flightlines</a> has a great reputation on the Biplane Forum, and are pretty much
the go to guys.</p>
<p>So, time to measure!</p>
<p>I had to re-clock the fittings on the engine fuel pump, so I loosened the jam nuts...</p>
<p>What? .... Jam nuts backed off, and fittings won't turn easily?! They should just unscrew!</p>
<p>Fittings moved with a wrench - and I discovered .. my favorite, The White Schmoo of Death. The teflon dope.</p>
<p>For some inexplicable reason, whomever undid the plumbing last time, re-plumbed it with the sealant everywhere. Okay, NPT fittings
need sealant (though, a choice of a crumbly drying type stuff is questionable - because when it's left in a female fitting, getting
it out without it getting it's crumbs into the system is almost impossible). But o-ring boss? Where there's a straight thread fitting
with a nut and an o-ring? No sir! The o-ring seals it just fine! Siiigh.</p>
<p>Here it is. That lovely sealant.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2020-04-29-hosed/h-3.jpg" title="Sealant where it shouldn't be" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2020-04-29-hosed/h-3-thumb.jpg" title="Sealant where it shouldn't be" alt="Sealant where it shouldn't be" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Sealant where it shouldn't be</p><p>I already <a class="reference external" href="http://79ft.net/entries/2019-05-17-race-for-the-engine/">had a ton of questionable fun</a> when trying to get
it out of the TBI. Frankly, I was glad I tossed the TBI altogether, hoping that that was the only place I'd
find that sealant... Only to.. Oh well.</p>
<p>I had to take the pump out. No way I could clean out that damn stuff out of the hole w/o getting it all inside.</p>
<p>Slowly and steadily, with the hole pointed down, I scraped and scraped and scraped it with my dental pick, followed with a brush wetted
in Goof Off that kinda softens it. It was.. hours. For two holes.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Clean.</p><p>Phew. The pump went back on, and finally, I could clock the fittings how I wanted them.</p>
<p>I used a few old hoses I had lying around, and chunks of safety wire to mock up my new ones; measured the mockups, and
made a bunch of pictures like this:</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2020-04-29-hosed/h-15.jpg" title="A drawing of a hose" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2020-04-29-hosed/h-15-thumb.jpg" title="A drawing of a hose" alt="A drawing of a hose" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">A drawing of a hose</p><p>Next morning, I called TS.</p>
<p>Tom, the owner, is the guy who answers the phone. A quick email with pictures, a quick conversation about various hose ends
(we ended up doing a few -3's instead of -2's as I had before), etc etc - and the order was in.</p>
<p>And, a few days later, a box showed up at my door!</p>
<p>Next time at the hangar, I tried them on. The hoses were perfect! But, something I haven't considered before...</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2020-04-29-hosed/h-21.jpg" title="Tee to engine pump" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2020-04-29-hosed/h-21-thumb.jpg" title="Tee to engine pump" alt="Tee to engine pump" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Tee to engine pump</p><p>There's a tee. Right side is connected to the gascolator. Left side - to the electrical pump. Both horizontal sides
of the tee are connected with aluminum tubing. Notice the adel on the right holding onto the flare nut. The adel on the left,
barely visible, is holding onto the <em>tube</em> - motor mount geometry isn't allowing it to grab onto the nut.</p>
<p>And the whole thing is aluminum, and the hose is creating a ton of leverage onto that tee.</p>
<p>It's not the problem with my hose. I should've realized this before I even ventured there. The old hose had the same problem, of course.</p>
<p>Aluminum has fatigue life. The motor shakes. The whole thing shakes, connected by the hose. How that tee didn't crack is...
anyone's guess. On top of that, how the tube didn't crack is even more miraculous.</p>
<p>I showed it to Deene Ogden - one of our Chapter's very experienced guys. He agreed with my hunch. His suggested fix was to attempt
to tie that hose end somehow into the firewall, so that it doesn't create that much leverage.</p>
<p>Well, easier said than done. Firewall on this thing is .035 - and not rigid at all.</p>
<p>I showed it to Tom (the TS Flightlines guy). He thought that even the fact that there's aluminum tubing between firewall
and engine mount is a bad thing - though there the relative motion is small, it still might crack a tube or a flare.</p>
<p>Top that with my general dislike towards the non-firesleeved sections of aluminum tubing firewall forward (I admit, I actually
attempted to figure out a nice way to sleeve them), and incorrectly plumbed fuel transducer (it was on the &quot;suction&quot; side -
before all the pumps - and it <em>is</em> a restriction - and a restriction on a sucking side is a potential for vapor lock) - and I,
in my usual manner, decided to, of course, rebuild the whole thing.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="disassembly">
<h2>Disassembly</h2>
<p>Well, that was easy - except for my favorite white crap everywhere. All the fittings were aluminum, and most of the fittings
weren't AN.</p>
<p>Now, similar to a conversation of which sealant to use on NPT threads (you can start a fight amongst best friends by bringing it up!),
there's a massive holy war on aluminum vs. steel FWF. I am in the steel camp.</p>
<p>And there's another, smaller holy war, about using &quot;racing&quot; fittings. Folks that do say &quot;if it's good for NASCAR, it's good
enough for us&quot;. I don't know. I don't buy that. First of, those fittings are of extremely varying quality (AN level all the way
down to cheap Chinesium). Second, race cars are rebuilt all the time - and in an airplane, I bet some of those are 40 years old. Or 20.
You get the idea.</p>
<p>So I am firmly in the &quot;AN, steel&quot; camp. Even though they are $20 a pop.</p>
<p>Transducer was the hardest to clean out, because I needed to make sure none of that white crud went into it. My friend and hangar neighbor Dick G. suggested running a tap with flutes filled with grease to pick up the crud... hmm... I didn't have the right size
tap, and that sounded a bit too extreme.. but the idea..</p>

</div>
<div class="section" id="the-plan-and-the-mockups">
<h2>The Plan, and the Mockups</h2>
<p>So since we're redoing the whole thing; first thing I was gonna do is dump the parallel plumbing of the pumps. I guess,
Remo's idea was that in case the electric pump fails in a mode where it blocks the flow of fuel thru it, the gas
will still be able to go thru the &quot;alternative&quot; branch and still reach the mechanical pump.</p>
<p>Not sure about that. I am very used to Grummans, which are plumbed in series (electrical -&gt; engine pump -&gt; carb),
and I have not heard of a single failure there. I have heard of this type failure on an RV, which used a solid state
Facet pump that Facet tells you not to use on airplanes.</p>
<p>Okay, actually, this whole Facet pump situation is interesting, apparently. Bendix used to make these electrical pumps, but
then Facet bought that part of their business. Nowadays, they explicitly tell you not to use their pumps on airplanes!</p>
<p>But, Dave Fletcher of <a class="reference external" href="http://fletchair.com">Fletchair</a> fame buys batches of particular Facet models, and runs tests on them. He
sells off the ones that don't pass (apparently, flow rates vary wildly), and tags the ones that pass. He then sells them to Grumman
folk.</p>
<p>Hey, good enough for Grumman - good enough for me! I can have my much simpler series system (less hoses, less connections, less
fittings, less space), and trust the pump. And they're cheap! (Well, relatively speaking).</p>
<p>So, I got a pump from Fletch and bolted it on.</p>
<p>Transducer was the next big ticket item. It had to go between the engine driven pump, and the carb - the &quot;last step&quot; in the chain.</p>
<p>I needed something to mock things up. I needed hose ends.</p>
<p>... now, what's with those racing hose ends?</p>
<p>I called Mario - a great guy who fixes my cars when I don't want to :). His thing is drag racing.</p>
<p>He knew a place.</p>
<p>Couple hours later, and with a lighter wallet, I had a bag of fittings that were close enough in size, and a chunk of hose to cut up.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2020-04-29-hosed/h-33.jpg" title="One of the first x-cer mockups" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2020-04-29-hosed/h-33-thumb.jpg" title="One of the first x-cer mockups" alt="One of the first x-cer mockups" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">One of the first x-cer mockups</p><p>This was the first. Followed what Fletcher did on the Cheetah back when we
<a class="reference external" href="http://79ft.net/entries/cgr-30/">installed the CGR-30</a>, but on the Cheetah the hose went back towards the firewall
and did a nice 180 u-turn, and came back to the carb. Here, I had to go &quot;sideways&quot; to do this &quot;hanging&quot; style if I wanted it. It
produced a weird low spot in the loop that I didn't like.</p>
<p>Next!</p>
<p>Could I maybe still have the x-cer on the firewall, and reuse some of the holes?</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2020-04-29-hosed/h-40.jpg" title="Second mockup" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2020-04-29-hosed/h-40-thumb.jpg" title="Second mockup" alt="Second mockup" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Second mockup</p><p>Much better I thought. I ran those by Tom of TS Flightlines. He thought the second setup was better, and recommended using
one of his fancy &quot;u-turn&quot;
fittings to save on the hose length. He gave me dimensions. I realized that I suck at mocking things up, and asked him if he
would be able to send me the fitting (I would gladly pay for it). He said, of course. He could send me whatever fittings I wanted,
and just figure the cost in the end. I'd make mockups and send them to him. Heck, he'd send me the hose too - and I'd cut it to size,
and make the hoses - then send them back to him, and he'll crimp and firesleeve them.</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>And he was a treasure trove of information. Basically, hand-held me all the way. And I took it, and am very grateful. This was my
first plumbing job - so I needed the help.</p>
<p>One big fear I had was running bent fittings before and after the transducer, because they can induce turbulence in the flow.
Tom said that they ran them in whichever configuration, and they work fine with the setup he was suggesting. That was a great relief
too.</p>
<p>So, I made my &quot;shopping&quot; list, and he put the fittings in the mail.</p>
<p>I got them, and ran over to the nearby auto parts place to get some hose for the mockup (I decided not to fiddle with cutting
braided teflon hose). The guy took me back, we found the right I.D. stuff. I asked for ten feet. &quot;This is fuel hose, it's expensive&quot;,
said the guy. I asked how much. &quot;Two-something a foot&quot;, was the response.</p>
<p>I almost cracked up. I then told him that the fitting I brought in to check, that one fitting, was probably twice as much as 10 feet
of that hose. We then had a very nice conversation about everything airplanes :).</p>
<p>My final mockup, with fittings from Tom, looked like this:</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">The Final Mockup</p><p>The gascolator hookup looks funny, doesn't it? It's &quot;reversed&quot; - because otherwise, I had no room for hoses at all.</p>
<p>And then, the mock hoses were sent back to Tom for final fabrication.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-gascolator">
<h2>The Gascolator</h2>
<p>Somewhere in between all the mocking up and messing around, I had to figure out what to do with the gascolator. See, it had no
mount. None.</p>
<p>It was basically &quot;hanging&quot; on the fittings coming into each side, and rigid aluminum tubing. Yeah. Ugh. But that's besides the
point - with flexible hoses, it'll be bouncing in that &quot;ring holder&quot; that isn't holding it at all, apparently.</p>
<p>I'll admit, buying a new gascolator with mounting options crossed my mind. But then.. I thought, maybe some kind of latch..</p>
<p>Something that will hook to the bottom of the ring on the gascolator, and the top of that &quot;bracket&quot; and pull it up.</p>
<p>I search McMaster and other catalogues and couldn't find anything... An idea crossed my mind.. maybe..</p>

<p>The diameter of the gascolator's top was a smidge undersized for the ring it was in - Glenn had some kind of a sticky foam
in there. I replaced it with proper, aircraft grade felt :).</p>

<p>The threads on that one.. looked even worse.</p>

then I somehow ended up with two? I think? All with bad threads.</p>
<p>All and all, I ended up with <em>five</em> bowls. That happened almost a year ago, and frankly, I don't exactly remember how exactly the
fifth happend, but I ended up with five.
And Spruce didn't want them back. And they refunded me the money.</p>
<p>But that was then. This was now. Now, I had a tap just the right size, and was set up in the hangar.</p>
<p>This is a 1/8&quot; NPT thread - so tapping it just a hair further would re-cut the bad parts and remove a bit more material, fixing
the threads.</p>
<p>So I took one of the bowls, re-tapped the hole, and started putting in the quickdrain. Ha! Not so easy. There's nothing on the bowl to
grab onto, and I had to tighten the quick drain pretty tight (1 1/2 to 2 turns past hand tight).</p>
<p>I kinda tried to use my vise to help me - holding onto the round thing isn't easy but I tried, using my hand too... Clack! The wrench
slipped, and the bowl went bouncing on the floor.</p>
<p>A bit of damage surveillance showed a nick on the lip where it contacts the rubber seal on the gascolator top, and my better part decided
that I need to be punished and re-do it. Heck, I had FIVE bowls!</p>
<p>So, I tapped the second one. The quick drain went in. It was annoying, but I managed. 1 1/2 turns.</p>
<p>Hmm.. Why does it look so weird... and not work?
Hmm.... Did the torque and compressing the hollow quickdrain with &quot;wedge&quot; action of NPT thread mess it up? Evidently.</p>
<p>But I turned it 1 1/2 turns!!</p>
<p>Idiot me, of course. The 1 1/2 turns is probably too much to begin with (though Vans recommends it in their manual). And besides, they
talk about AN plumbing fittings. Not special fittings like this quick drain.</p>
<p>I googled &quot;Curtiss Quick Drain Torque&quot;... Sure enough. Tiny. 40 inch pounds if I remember correctly. Way to be an idiot, dude.</p>
<p>But I have three more bowls to mess up!</p>
<p>Okay, bowl number three.... tap... attempt to hold... slip.. fall... DING! Damn.</p>
<p>This is stupid, I know. I had to stop and figure out a fixture to hold the bowl while torquing the fitting after the first one
slipped out of the vice (try holding a round object in a vice w/o a fixture?! Idiot). This was the ... &quot;try to get away with it&quot; mode.</p>
<p>Enough. See, I was in such a weird state of mind I didn't take any pictures?</p>
<p>And the solution was simple and right there, of course.</p>

<h2>The Hookups</h2>
<p>Well, the rest of this was fairly uneventful.</p>

   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2020-04-29-hosed/h-56-thumb.jpg" title="Hoses!" alt="Hoses!" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Hoses!</p><p>The hoses showed up, and I already had the fittings arrived earlier from Spruce.</p>
<p>I messed with the transducer a ton. That was another hard part to hold - and I'll admit to bending it's outside box
(that's non-sequitir but annoying). This transducer is weird - it has it's body and it's brains all in a very thin sheet stainless
&quot;box&quot;, making it virtually impossible to hold onto and screw the fitting in. But the bend in that body doesn't affect anything - it's
like a &quot;cover&quot;.</p>
<p>I'll admit to thinking I overtorqued the transducer fittings, too - and removing them to check for cracks (only to find that no,
I actually didn't overtorque them - the manufacturer's spec was higher).</p>
<p>But in the end, it all worked out for the initial hookup. I'll have to tighten everything and clean up the angles on the fittings
a bit when getting closer to the engine start; but the initial fit up worked great. Tom did a great job!</p>

<hr class="dashed"/><p>Pressure transducers. Those little doodads that take liquid pressure and transform it into electrical pixies on the
wire...</p>
<p>The ones I got are from <a class="reference external" href="http://umainstruments.com/">UMA</a>. I'm replacing the mechanical engine gauge with
electric - same 3-in-1 (oil temp, pressure, fuel pressure); but the fluids stay under the cowling. Pixies run
in the wires to the gauge and rat those fluids out to it.</p>
<p>Ahem.</p>
<p>Well, this was always a part of the plan:</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2020-02-23-xcers-brackets/b-1.jpg" title="Pressure transducer on adels" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2020-02-23-xcers-brackets/b-1-thumb.jpg" title="Pressure transducer on adels" alt="Pressure transducer on adels" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Pressure transducer on adels</p><p>but this never felt like sufficient. Only rubber (will harden up pronto) and screw torque (well, not too shabby,
but still) prevent it from rotating. Plus, a single point of failure - and I am probably over too sensitive to
a probability of dangling fluid hoses with transducers at the end under the cowling in flight.</p>
<p>No sir, we can do better!</p>
<p>Long time ago, I have <a class="reference external" href="http://79ft.net/entries/cgr-30/">installed a CGR-30 onto my Cheetah</a>,
and back then I mounted the transducers on two adels - but those were different style transducers, much longer
than the ones UMA makes.</p>
<p>But they have that threaded &quot;neck&quot; and a nut on it.. hmm... Let's see if we can make some
kind of a bracket?</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2020-02-23-xcers-brackets/b-2.jpg" title="Marking the hole" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2020-02-23-xcers-brackets/b-2-thumb.jpg" title="Marking the hole" alt="Marking the hole" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Marking the hole</p><p>Start with our good old friend aluminum angle. Now, the &quot;tab&quot; on the bracket will screw with another
adel on the motor mount; that was the idea (so the bracket basically was replacing a second adel around
the transducer that didn't fit). Therefore, the tab off of my bracket would have to be co-planar with the
adel. It did not have to be super precise - I figured, 1/32&quot; of mistake was fine.</p>
<p>A bit of black sharpie transferred the imprint quite nicely.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">The bracket taking shape</p><p>And then, bandsaw and sander. Had to break out my good files to clean up the &quot;fillet&quot; that
remained after cutting off one side of the angle under the nut (otherwise, the nut won't fit).</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Pferd and Grobet, the two buddies at work</p><p>OKay, now, let's add a bit more fanciness to it. Using the nut to draw out circumference and to make sure to
stay well clear for now</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Now, make it "flow"</p><p>This above picture also shows the filed area real well - bottom left.</p>
<p>Finally, need to drill the hole for the adjoining adel in the horizontal portion - that one needs to be somewhat
precise too, if the transducer is to sit straight. So, we'll test mount it on one adel, and mark out
the second hole using the second adel.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Jack likes the bracket very much.</p><p>But we have another transducer. That one's bracket will have to be &quot;mirror image&quot; of the first one.</p>

<p>They took a long time to show up, and then I was working on this amongst other things. Just finished now :).</p>
<p>So, right to it, shall we?</p>
<p>First things first was to get thru the firewall. I had these fancy penetration trims for cables called 'CableSafe' from Spruce</p>

<p>Hooked the clevis ends to the control cables, and the cables to the carb to verify everything.</p>
<p>When measuring, I figured I'd need a rod end for the mixture arm due to misalignment of the cable rod and the control arm. And
the damn bushing, too - because the hole in the carb is 1/4&quot;, and the bolt is #10. I got some bushing stock from McMaster, but
it was too long - had to shorten it with some creative sanding.</p>

<p>I kept thinking and thinking. It's motor -&gt; oil sump -&gt; carb -&gt; airbox -&gt; filter. That's how everything's bolted together. The first three are not &quot;home buit&quot;, so I didn't think they were off. So it must've been the airbox and / or the filter mount.</p>
<p>Upon closer examination, I realized that the airbox was welded together way off, and is crooked itself. And the filter is mounted
even more crooked in the same clockwise direction.</p>
<p>To confirm, searched all the pics I could find online of the plane prior to my having it (and disassembling the front).</p>
<p>It was hard to tell, but.. I think it was like this from the very beginning.</p>
<p>Phew.</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>Meanwhile, we had a night of a kind of weather when it rains without actually raining - you know, as if you are in a cloud with
large droplets. Everything in the hangar got soaked, obviously. Including my clevis ends.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Rust on a new rod end?!</p><p>Aren't they supposed to be cad plated? Oh; and that was the first time I really noticed how cad plating sacrifices itself to prevent
rust on steel - a lot of my hardware was covered in little white stains, which were cadmium having corroded and saved steel.</p>
<p>At any rate, I double checked the order paperwork. &quot;Cad plated&quot;. Hmmmm. They definitely were <em>not</em>.</p>
<p>Called Spruce. She checked and doublechecked - and confirmed that indeed, their vendor stopped doing cad plated clevis forks specifically in that dimension - #10 end, #10 rod. They refunded my money, and let me keep the forks.</p>
<p>Called SkyGeek, asking about the clevis forks they sell. The lady goes, &quot;yep, plated&quot;. I ask her to triple-confirm.</p>
<p>She takes about 10 minutes, and gets back to me - nope, not plated. She's sorry. No longer made.</p>
<p>John F., a local IA, confirmed. Only plain steel now, seems that cad plated forks are unobtanium. Crap! Oh well, I guess, paying
attention and making sure to put oil or something similar on them from time to time is in my future.</p>

<p>Glenn had a carb temp probe in the Rotec TBI I am replacing, and I decided to try to keep it. Wire was cut way too short for how
everything's on the carb (vs. the TBI), so I spent a bit of time pondering if:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The probe was a thermistor, or a thermocouple</li>
<li>If latter, could I successfully extend it</li>
</ul>
<p>Pouring thru (mostly AeroLectric Bob Nuckoll's) notes on thermocouples, realized that some are magnetic. Let's see.. score!
Magnetic indeed.</p>
<p>Got some multi-strand thermocouple wire of the same kind (red/yellow - I forget which metals those are :) ), and did some &quot;back-bench&quot;
testing.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Hook up the probe direct to the gauge</li>
<li>Pour solvent onto the probe tip, watch for rate of temp change and lowest point</li>
<li>Extend the wire now, do the pour again</li>
<li>Subjectively decide if the indications were &quot;roughly matching&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>They seemed to have been indeed matching, so I decided to attempt to keep the probe.</p>
<p>But, problem. It'd interfere with the airbox'es mounting bracket (and for some reason, I didn't take a picture of that :( ).</p>
<p>So first, let's cut a slot that will let that bracket clear the wire.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Slot</p><p>A bit of drilling, a bit of hacksawing, and a bit of filing.</p>
<p>Then,</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Trial fit</p><p>Nope, still not good. The carb temp probe there is the little thing that looks like a bolt with a wire sticking out of it -
and it's hex was interfering a bit. But we cleared the wire now.</p>
<p>So, a touch more cutting was in order.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2020-02-21-carb-finished/c-18.jpg" title="A touch more cutting" >

 </a> <p class="small text-center">A touch more cutting</p><p>... and it fit.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Since I was messing with the airbox, needed to finish one last thing on it.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Carb heat bowden bracket</p><p>That bracket holds the carb heat bowden cable. Notice something weird? Yep, castellated <em>shear nuts</em> and <em>pins</em>. And, no, they weren't
tight either, so the whole bracket business was wobbling around.</p>
<p>I spent quite some time pondering why would it be set up like that. Castellated, pin, not tight, wobble - all of that adds up to
&quot;he wanted that bracket to move around&quot;. It adds up really well too! The setup makes total sense if he wanted to have this
arm move around - but there is absolutely no reason for it to do that! In fact, it's not good at all - steel bracket with steel bolts
moving around holes drilled thru aluminum airbox - that would elongate and tear up those holes!</p>
<p>I decided that no. It should not move around, in fact. So,</p>

<p>And then, the final hookups of everything after a long break. Routed the cables, and hooked them up with adel clamps where necessary
(doing that conforms them to their final shape, which causes some changes in positions of the cable and controls and the range of
motion).</p>
<p>Then, fine-tuned positioning of the controls, and tightened the pivot bolt on the bellcranks. Clevis pins might still need to come out
- and that's why cotter pins aren't bent yet - just in case I'll need to unhook them again.</p>

<p>Nowhere near.</p>
<p>You see, one of the things I wanted to fix prior to putting the plane back in the air was this.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Wing root fairing</p><p>You're looking at the bottom right wing root fairing, all oily and burnt up, with paint flaking.
It is bad. Really bad.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because it is bathed in the exhaust, and because Glenn added the smoke system on top of that.</p>
<p>Here's the best couple  pictures I have to illustrate what's going on.</p>

You can see how in the slipstream this will hit the wing root and the side, which is very much evidenced by the stains,
oil streaks, and, well, burnt up paint on the fairing.</p>
<p>I wanted to fix this very, very, very much.</p>
<div class="section" id="research">
<h2>Research</h2>
<p>As much as I am absolutely <em>not</em> afraid of electrical systems, I am very afraid of exhaust systems (and a few other things).
I just don't know enough or have enough experience.</p>
<p>What turned up to be even worse was trying to find someone who <em>does</em> know what they're talking about. I poked around, and couldn't find
anyone around or in our Chapter that knows this stuff well to be able to tell me &quot;do this, and I got a TIG machine in the corner
to weld up whatever you need&quot;.</p>
<p>So, I did the second best thing I could.</p>
<p>A couple years back, I met a gentleman at Oshkosh at our Biplane Forum gathering, Mr. T., who wrote a series of articles on motors,
including exhaust.</p>
<p>He agreed graciously to listen to me (well, &quot;read&quot;, technically) rant, and maybe guide me a bit.</p>
<p>So, to the drawing board!</p>
<p>I had to put the system back on, and hang the cowling back on the airplane as well, so that I could check everything in place.</p>
<p>When I took the exhaust system off, I plugged the stubs coming off of cylinders with duct tape. Big mistake!</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2020-02-17-exhaust/e-4.jpg" title="Duct tape on the stubs" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2020-02-17-exhaust/e-4-thumb.jpg" title="Duct tape on the stubs" alt="Duct tape on the stubs" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Duct tape on the stubs</p><p>Cleaning that crap off took GoofOff and about an hour.</p>

   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2020-02-17-exhaust/e-6-thumb.jpg" title="Old tailpipe" alt="Old tailpipe" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Old tailpipe</p><p>That's the head on picture of the old stub.</p>
<p>The first and the easiest possibility was, what would happen if I just extended it straight out?</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2020-02-17-exhaust/e-8.jpg" title="Straight extension - head on" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2020-02-17-exhaust/e-8-thumb.jpg" title="Straight extension - head on" alt="Straight extension - head on" >

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Straight extension - side view</p><p>I used a piece of paper to mock that up. Mind you, that'd be about a 10&quot; extension! Lots of pipe, considering that the original tailpipe
was maybe 16 inches long total.</p>
<p>It was obvious that doing this would move the exhaust outboard way more than moving it down. Why is this bad? Well, the bulk of it was
hitting the aluminum side of the fuse and the plastic (okay, okay, fiberglass :) ) root fairing. Moved out this way, it would be
hitting the fabric-covered leading edge. Somehow, that didn't sit well with me, and Mr. T. concurred.</p>
<p>So, I went on a scavenging run, and borrowed a nice piece of exhaust grade 3&quot; SCAT from Mr. Dick G., my friendly neighbor, and attempted
to mock something up with that.</p>
<p>Now <em>that</em> went way better!</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2020-02-17-exhaust/e-9.jpg" title="Approx 45 degrees" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2020-02-17-exhaust/e-9-thumb.jpg" title="Approx 45 degrees" alt="Approx 45 degrees" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Approx 45 degrees</p><p>That moved the exhaust point downward, and I realized that I could play with it even more by bringing it closer to the airbox via
cutting progressively more off of the old tailpipe (at this point with SCAT I haven't yet cut anything, because I was just playing
and wasn't committed).</p>
<p>That seemed like a way to go. So, next step was to mock this up with a real 45 degree bend.</p>
<p>I got the cheapest slip-on 45 degree mandrel bend from Summit.</p>
<p>At this point, I had to commit, because using this slip-on would require some cutting.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2020-02-17-exhaust/e-10.jpg" title="Some cutting" >

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Side view</p><p>That looked just perfect! A total of about 8 inches of tube added overall, and the exhaust actually moved inboard, and way down into
the slip stream.</p>
<p>All that was left to do was to buy the actual 45 degree bend I'd be using, and find a welder.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="unobtanium">
<h2>Unobtanium</h2>
<p>I was looking around for welder who'd be willing and able while playing with the geometry. Asking around the airport didn't yield much.</p>
<p>Backup plan was Seth from <a class="reference external" href="https://marioshopllc.com/">Marioshop</a> - the guy I take my cars to (his boss is a dragster, and Seth welded a lot of tube and exhaust -
although, automotive, much thicker kind, with MIG).</p>
<p>I contacted folks from another EAA Chapter, the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.eaa59.org/">Waco 59</a>, a great and dynamic EAA Chapter which I am also
a member of, and scored - their very experienced Tech Counselor and metalworker Mike M. agreed to help me with the project. He welded
himself, and also knew a gentleman that was &quot;very artistic with his welds&quot;, as he put it.</p>
<p>I just had to get the material, jig it up to position it, and come over to weld everything up.</p>
<p>My tailpipe was 3 inches in diameter (jumping a bit ahead of myself, unusual for a motor of my size - too big). I measured .049 with
my dial calipers, which translated into 18GA, and ordered the nicest shiny new bend from Summit. When it came, I realized...</p>
<p>It was the wrong thing.</p>
<p>Way thicker than what I had.</p>
<p>I think I mis-measured. Maybe I was asleep when I did it, maybe there was a lot of crud on the old pipe and I didn't pay attention,
maybe .. but I needed 0.035 material. 20 gauge.</p>
<p>Quick Internet search - nothing.</p>
<p>More Internet searching - nothing.</p>
<p>I could buy all kinds of bends in smaller diameter tubing with 0.035 wall thickness. I could buy 3&quot; tubing with 0.049 wall. I could <em>not</em> find
3&quot; 45 degree bend in 0.035.</p>
<p>One company offered to sell me a straight piece. That was a good backup - we could've mitered and welded up the 45 degree bend in
sections, but I wanted to see if I could find a bend. That same company offered to make me one - at a low price of about 600 bucks.
Yikes!</p>
<p>Attempting to Hail Mary again, I <a class="reference external" href="https://www.biplaneforum.com/threads/sources-for-large-diameter-ss-exhaust-tubing-bends.19296/#post-228307">posted on the Biplane Forum</a>. Guys came back with a bunch of phone ##s of their contacts, and I started calling around!</p>
<p>Nope, nope, nope. I don't remember who it was, but one of the guys I called suggested contacting
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.customaircraft.com/">Custom Aircraft Parts</a>.</p>
<p>A nice lady answered. &quot;You gotta talk to Clint&quot;, she said, and transferred me.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="clint">
<h2>Clint</h2>
<p>Clint picked up. I asked if they could sell me the  bend. Clint asked, &quot;What are you trying to do&quot;?</p>
<p>I explained.</p>
<p>He asked for pictures. A bit weirded out, I sent them over.</p>
<p>&quot;I have two things I wanna tell you&quot;, said Clint.</p>
<p>&quot;Buy yourself a bottle of soap and a nice rag&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;Be careful what you wish for&quot;.</p>
<p>Clit knew this 4-into-1 setup with a muffler in between very well. He told me  that even with me trying to keep the extension
as short as possible, I was running a risk of it cracking off at the muffler. Would it for sure? He didn't know. But the risk was
increasing a lot.</p>
<p>I called my old friend and a Grumman aficionado Ben the same night. Grummans have this style mufflers (mine didn't by the way
because it was sporting Powerflow - a very different system).</p>
<p>&quot;Hey, do you recall welding cracked off tailpipes?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;For sure&quot;.</p>
<p>Damn! Damn damn damn.</p>
<p>More mulling over ensued. I did <em>not</em> want to risk a tail pipe cracked off at the muffler. No way. That puts hot exhaust into a very
tight cowling. On a biplane. With my having elevated fear of any in flight fire. Remember, I embarked on the electrical
rebuild because I judged this airplane to be a <a class="reference external" href="http://79ft.net/entries/2019-05-16-fire-hazard/">flying fire hazard</a>.</p>
<p>I talked with Ben more. I talked with Mike from Waco 59 more.</p>
<p>The attempted fix solidified.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2020-02-17-exhaust/e-14.jpg" title="Exhaust hanger" >

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Exhaust hanger</p><p>I would put a ball joint somewhere close to the muffler, with one end on the old pipe, and one end on the new extension that includes
the bend. That ball would isolate the extension from the existing system, and allow them to move relative to one another.</p>
<p>I would then hang the new extension to the oil sump on some kind of hanger with a clamp - likely, a kind of tube with ends flattened
and bent as required.</p>
<p>I sent this schematic to Clint. Well, no, not this one. This is a nice one I did when writing this post, over a picture I took
when mocking up this solution. The one I sent to Clint was this. But, same idea.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Schematic I sent to Clint</p><p>Clint's response? Verbatim:</p>
<p><em>Adding a ball joint and brace solves all of my concerns, you are free to do anything you want to the tailpipe. If you weld the bend on as your latest drawing shows, looks more reasonable. When adding a support brace it is imperative that it stabilizes the tailpipe to the engine, they must move together.</em></p>
<p>WOOT! Did I find a way to do what I wanted?</p>
<p>One thing to absolutely ensure was that the ball joint would fit.</p>
<p>We went back and forth a bit, me asking about dimensions. Then, I threw together a quick drawing of the widest part of the ball
joint - the clamp holding it together - and tried it next time I was in the hangar.</p>
<p>No way. No way it hell it would fit. Airbox would get in the way.</p>
<p>Here's probably the best picture I have of why.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Clearances</p><p>That little triangle of &quot;air&quot; in between the cowling (bottom), exhaust pipe, and airbox is probably 1 inch on sides. No way a ball
would fit in there. No freaking way.</p>
<p>So, what am I left with?</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="putting-it-back-together-the-way-it-was">
<h2>Putting it Back Together, the Way It Was</h2>
<p>I gave up.</p>
<p>Called Clint on the way back from the airport, and asked him to sell me a straight length of pipe with a slip fit on one end.</p>
<p>Got it a week later.</p>
<p>Called Mike, got a contact for his welder, and went there.</p>
<p>The gentleman didn't like the fit - too loose - and wanted to make sure I pinned it exactly where I wanted (and actually,
I should've done that in the first place, because the opening in the cowling is very tight, and just a degree of being off would
make it interfere with the cowling). He also wanted me to clean all the gunk off.</p>
<p>So, back to the hangar, and fun fun fun with a die grinder, deburring wheel, wire brush... This 40 year old exhaust is gunky!!!</p>

in the exact clocking I needed.</p>
<p>Mike's welder fell thru, and that cost me a couple weeks at least. I focused on some other work - panels, compass, etc.</p>
<p>One of those days, I was on the phone with D. when a gentleman I didn't recognise walked over from the hangar next door housing a PT-19,
and asked to borrow a hex key.  When I hung up, I walked over to introduce myself.</p>
<p>&quot;Hi, I'm M.&quot;</p>
<p>M.?! <strong>The</strong> M.?</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>He's somewhat of a local celebrity, having built a ton of airplanes, and having worked on more. I met him on a couple occasions in
passing, but not really, and I didn't remember his face when he walked over. He's a sheet metal and generally a metal
guy. He was working on the PT-19's electrical (ha, fun coincidence, eh?)</p>
<p>A lot of hangar flying ensued.</p>
<p>He looked over the biplane. He told me of his building a replica <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hughes_H-1_Racer">Hughes H-1</a>.
Of <em>his own design</em> basically.</p>
<p>When parting ways, I asked, &quot;Hey, do you have a welder by any chance?&quot; Asking doesn't hurt right?
&quot;Yep, I got a TIG machine&quot;.</p>
<p>Ha! Of course :) I meant to ask if he <em>knew</em> a welder. But he <em>was</em> one. I should've thought of that myself.</p>
<p>He agreed to help me weld the damn thing back on, of course. He asked for me to clean the insides. It kinda made sense, too - you want
full penetration when welding, and you don't want all that crud on the inside of the tube to &quot;float up&quot;.</p>
<p>So, lots more of a die grinder time, with flapwheels, with a compressor barely large enough to run the damn thing for a minute straight.</p>
<p>Then, drove to M's shop, drooled over the H-1 and the MP-14 that he had on it.</p>
<p>And then, the final fit of the tailpipe to put it where it was when I cut it off.</p>
<p>We put the exhaust back on the plane,..</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Rubber band maybe?</p><p>Rubber bands actually worked quite well. The kind I had was too tight, and I was playing with it trying to make it work and considering
running to a nearby Office Depot, when I was offered a schematic to help guide me.</p>

them a bit more to fit them over the new pipe, but that worked quite well in the end.</p>

<hr class="dashed"/><p>A couple things have been always on the back burner - fuse blocks, and finishing up the oil cooler bowden hookup.</p>
<p>In between waiting for completion of The Thing I Am Yet To Write About, finally, checked those off the list.</p>
<div class="section" id="fuse-blocks">
<h2>Fuse Blocks</h2>
<p>Location was figured out <a class="reference external" href="http://79ft.net/entries/2019-09-08-fwf-side-channel-panel-layouts/">a long time ago</a>, and I just
clamped them in place, center punched the holes, and drilled them.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Clamped in place for hole marking</p><p>One little bit was to figure out the exact fastener lengths and washer stacks, because the right one had it's right (forward most) end riding
on top of a reasonably thick aluminum placard you will see much better in the following picture.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2020-02-16-fuseblocks-oil-bowden/fb-2.jpg" title="Fuse blocks: mounted" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2020-02-16-fuseblocks-oil-bowden/fb-2-thumb.jpg" title="Fuse blocks: mounted" alt="Fuse blocks: mounted" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Fuse blocks: mounted</p><p>Done! Done?</p>
<p>You are forgetting, my Dear Reader. We here are in the <em>misery</em> business. Look carefully at the curvature of the fuselage. Imagine the
side panel, open on the pictures, closed over our &quot;conduit&quot;, on which the fuse blocks are installed. Do you see how the available &quot;depth&quot;
will be bigger in the middle of the conduit as compared to the top?</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>Of course, the panel won't close. With fuses installed, they would rub on the side panel. Not Good.</p>
<p>But relocating them down? What's the problem? Bowden cables, of course! I'd be too close to them, and I wanted very much to isolate my
wire bundle and my bowdens; but even if I didn't, I still won't have enough room there for a terminal, and a nice 90 degree &quot;turn&quot; for the
wire to go sideways (either towards the panel, or towards the firewall).</p>
<p>Solution?</p>
<p>Well.. there weren't any good ones, so I ended up taking the best of the crappy ones.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2020-02-16-fuseblocks-oil-bowden/fb-3.jpg" title="Final fuseblock mount locations" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2020-02-16-fuseblocks-oil-bowden/fb-3-thumb.jpg" title="Final fuseblock mount locations" alt="Final fuseblock mount locations" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Final fuseblock mount locations</p><p>Not ideal, because they're flipped over - so <em>technically</em>, condensation can run down and into the fuse socket. Not a good situation to be
in, but I can't do anything here. I guess, inspecting this area for corrosion is going to be on my Regular Maintenance List.</p>
<p>Oh, and I ended up with four <em>extra</em> perfectly drilled and deburred holes, right in the passenger's cockpit. That's what is on the other side
of that &quot;conduit&quot;.</p>
<p>I guess, I will attach a placard to them stating that those are &quot;hole samples&quot; or something (my friend Dick Gossen placarded a missing screw in his instrument panel once,
so I figure I am allowed as well).</p>

<h2>Oil Cooler Bowden</h2>
<p>When <a class="reference external" href="http://79ft.net/entries/2019-09-08-fwf-side-channel-panel-layouts/">headscratching about</a>, and later
<a class="reference external" href="http://79ft.net/entries/2019-10-09-vr-mounted/">installing the voltage regulator</a>, Oil Cooler Air Shutoff Valve bowden was relocated
(and because of that, I had to use a longer Bowden, which, gladly, I had an extra of after removing the Rotec's Throttle Body Injector).</p>
<p>All that was left was cut it to size, and install it into the valve's pivot arm.</p>
<p>Cutting bowdens? I don't know, I think it's easy. Pull out the actual control wire, and use bolt cutters. Push the wire back in, and trim
to desired length.</p>
<p>Done.</p>
<p>Here's the pivot arm.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Pivot Arm Wire Bushing</p><p>No worries, we can file that shoulder down....</p>
<p>The other minor problem? The hole that clamps the &quot;eye&quot; that holds the bowden's outer housing in place was drilled too close to the place
where the eye begins. Result? Flat washer was too big to lay flat.</p>
<p>Oh well.</p>

<hr class="dashed"/><p>While waiting for someone else to get back to me to help me finish &lt;the thing that took last month and a half
and  is yet to be written about&gt;, I decided to work on the panel a bit.</p>
<p>Lighting strip seemed like a nice place to start.</p>
<p>It's a simple LED strip that I planned to glue right behind coaming on the underside of the eyebrow. This way, it'd be
invisible from pretty much any angle.</p>
<p>But, the wires! The wires in <em>front</em> of the panel, that have to go to the behinds.. No worries I thought, I'd make  a small
hole / slit in the top of the panel, also invisible - and fish the wires thru there.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2020-01-29-light-and-compass/lc-1.jpg" title="The Plan" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2020-01-29-light-and-compass/lc-1-thumb.jpg" title="The Plan" alt="The Plan" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">The Plan</p><p>That was the plan.</p>
<p>Reality, of course, decided to disagree.</p>
<p>The plan was to take out all the screws that went around the top of the panel, and tilt it &quot;down&quot; - so that I
could use a drill comfortably to make the little slit for the wires.</p>
<p>Couple screws came out nice.</p>
<p>I think the third one came out like...</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2020-01-29-light-and-compass/lc-2.jpg" title="?!" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2020-01-29-light-and-compass/lc-2-thumb.jpg" title="?!" alt="?!" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">?!</p><p>Did I just bust a screw? I looked into the hole. <em>Empty?!</em></p>
<p>Upon further examination, I found... glue? What? The screw head was... glued into the hole? That's a first.</p>
<p>After taking the rest of the screws out, I realized what happened.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2020-01-29-light-and-compass/lc-3.jpg" title="Backside of the panel" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2020-01-29-light-and-compass/lc-3-thumb.jpg" title="Backside of the panel" alt="Backside of the panel" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Backside of the panel</p><p>This is the back side of the panel. The panel is attached thru those little tabs and nutplates.</p>
<p>Notice the nutplates using rigid (not floating) style nuts? A slight misdrilling of the holes in the panel, and screws
won't go in at all.</p>
<p>So, there were two &quot;screws&quot; that were just heads glued in - yep - and two more that used #6 screw in a #8 nut - the TPI on those is the same, and the holes were drilled sufficiently close enough to let a #6 screw pass thru; but not a #8. Le.. Sigh.</p>
<p>To top it all off, the panel won't fold down for me to get access to where I wanted to be, and to fish it out I'd have to take
out the carb heat bowden cable that was attached to it. Too much trouble if I can avoid it (that carb heat cable would've
been a 3-4 hour affair just by itself).</p>
<p>Plan B solidified; but first the panel had to be put back.</p>
<p>I ended up putting #6 screws into all the misdrilled holes (sorry, but glueing heads into holes is.. not my thing :)); but I installed nuts on them on the back. Effectively, set up like this the nutplates don't do anything - just add weight. See
the picture above - it has the nut over that nutplate. That nut, by the way, was a pain to get in - see how close another nut is to it?</p>
<p>I think all the fiddling with the panel, screws, nuts, washers (losing a few of them and going on fishing expedition
to pull them out of the guts of the plane included, of course), and trying to get it back in right took what.. around 6 hours?</p>
<p>The plan B, now executable after the panel was back in, was to route the wire under the eyebrow, and fish it thru behind
the coaming to the &quot;top&quot; side right in the middle, where the compass was to be. It then would join the compass light
wire, and go to behind the panel land.</p>
<p>So, the strip was glued, and the wire attached to under the eyebrow with <em>HVAC duct sealing tape</em>, ahem, aircraft grade
glue backed aluminum sheeting from the local friendly Aerospace Depot.</p>

an inspection mirror the only view. Like this:</p>

<hr class="dashed"/><p>This is all your fault, you know who!</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Way back, when working on the new layout for switches on the panel, I was thinking about how to re-label them.</p>
<p>I had a nice Brady label maker, and was thinking about just printing and sticking some tags over existing, painted, lettering,
on the switch placards.</p>
<p>One of the nights, when I was tired enough to do anything useful, I was playing with the stickers, and posted this picture
here:</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-11-23-switch-plates/p-100.jpg" title="Playing with placards" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-11-23-switch-plates/p-100-thumb.jpg" title="Playing with placards" alt="Playing with placards" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Playing with placards</p><p>The you-know-who-you-are, of course, wasn't happy (this gentleman is an actual friend of mine, not a silly voice in my head).
&quot;They will fall off&quot;, he said. &quot;Can't you do something a bit more professional&quot;? &quot;Can't you draw them up, and order them to be custom made&quot;?</p>
<p>Order?</p>
<p>Ha!</p>
<p>No. This whole exercise in airplane handling is to put yourself thru as much misery as possible. So the placards had to be
made, not ordered. I mean, I could've ordered my electrical redone too, right? :)</p>
<p>I recalled that I read somewhere on Vintage Machinery that someone figured out a neat way to restore old
data plates on old lathes and such. Looking it up, I remembered.</p>
<p>Etching!</p>
<p>The idea is basic - make a mask, transfer it to a piece of metal, soak it in acid, paint, sand - your recessed (etched) areas will
keep paint, while the elevated (masked out) areas will sand out. This way, you get metal-on-paint look, and it's nice and
pretty.</p>
<p>So, it has been decided - I will etch out my switch placards!</p>
<p>First, though, I had to figure out...</p>
<div class="section" id="the-process">
<h2>The Process</h2>
<p>Obviously, SolidWorks would be instrumental in making the actual pattern. I wanted to make the placards out of brass, so that
lettering would be yellow, and I'd paint them black, for the yellow on black final result.</p>
<p>First, the mask.</p>
<p>Searching around, it seemed that the most reasonable way to go about it would be to use Toner Transfer technique. Laser printer
toner (at least on a good subset of laser printers) is basically powdered plastic. Printer warms it up, which makes it sticky -
and toner then fuses itself to
paper. It can be re-softened (and made sticky again) by a normal household iron or a laminator. I had both - an iron, obviously;
but we also had a great &quot;office grade&quot; laminator in the office.</p>
<p>A lot of folks had success with glossy paper (glossy paper doesn't absorb melted toner, it sticks, but stays on top), but I, looking
around, found a lot of good reviews of the <a class="reference external" href="https://pcbfx.com">PCB Fab in a Box</a> system.</p>
<p>Not only the guy makes a very nice toner transfer paper which &quot;releases&quot; the toner when soaked in water (it works just like your
model decals in plastic models, you soak the paper, and the top layer comes off), he also seems to have researched and cleaned up
the process to minutia. For example, the toner itself is porous (indeed!) so he uses an extra layer of plastic to &quot;fuse&quot; the
micro-gaps between toner granulas as transferred  with another layer called &quot;TRF Foil&quot;. He also did a lot of research into
printers, toners, application techniques and such - and published a great handbook. Just for that alone, I wanted him to have my
money.</p>
<p>So, I ordered the transfer paper (the one you print your mask on), and tried the first step - transferring it to a small strip of
brass in a laminator.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-11-23-switch-plates/p-1.jpg" title="Laminator with envelope with the workpiece" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-11-23-switch-plates/p-1-thumb.jpg" title="Laminator with envelope with the workpiece" alt="Laminator with envelope with the workpiece" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Laminator with envelope with the workpiece</p> <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-11-23-switch-plates/p-2.jpg" title="Transferred!" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-11-23-switch-plates/p-2-thumb.jpg" title="Transferred!" alt="Transferred!" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Transferred!</p><p>What's wrong with that picture? Riiight! I forgot to mirror the pattern :). Damn.</p>
<p>I messed around quite a bit with density, too. Just default settings were crap, obviously. Bumping up the density to max didn't help
much. I installed a new toner cartridge, and that improved the density dramatically - while not perfect, it would've been workable,
hopefully, with the addition of the TRF foil (and, if I saw any obvious holes, I could fill them with a sharpie).</p>
<p>Okay. But the basic test worked! The pattern transferred nicely.</p>
<p>Second time, I threw together another test mask with a couple of different fonts about the size I'd want on the placards -
I was gonna transfer those to a small chunk of brass bar stock, and try etching.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-11-23-switch-plates/p-5.jpg" title="Second pattern" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-11-23-switch-plates/p-5-thumb.jpg" title="Second pattern" alt="Second pattern" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Second pattern</p><p>With the help of child labor, patterns were cut out, and transferred successfully to the brass bar stock.
I then applied the green TRF foil (that stuff that fuses the pores between toner's grains) to it.</p>
<p>Side note: the process manual from <a class="reference external" href="https://pcbfx.com">PCB Fab in a Box</a> notes explicitly that Brother printers have a kind
of toner that requires much higher than usual laminator's temps to melt. I have a Brother printer, but  since I was able to do
my first transfer successfully, I kinda decided to not bother - it worked, so I must be the lucky one right? Though I admit, I did entertain an idea of a new
printer... ;)</p>
<p>On one of the evenings, I had a block of a few hours, and the weather was nice. I had all my chemicals (ferric chloride PCB
etching solution and boxes of baking soda to neutralize it afterwards), so I decided to try the actual etching process.</p>
<p>I hooked up the test plate to a piece of closed cell foam (to float it on top of acid)...</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-11-23-switch-plates/p-8.jpg" title="Brass with mask hooked up" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-11-23-switch-plates/p-8-thumb.jpg" title="Brass with mask hooked up" alt="Brass with mask hooked up" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Brass with mask hooked up</p><p>...set up a small plastic table outside the hangar...</p>

   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-11-23-switch-plates/p-7-thumb.jpg" title="The setup" alt="The setup" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">The setup</p><p>...and went to town.</p>
<p>The idea was to try to get the ferric chloride to about 100 degrees F to speed up the process, so I did a hot water tub (hence, the
little camp stove in my setup).</p>
<p>I'd have a large tub with hot water, and a small tub with etching solution in it, with the workpiece floating on top, hooked up to
the foam.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-11-23-switch-plates/p-9.jpg" title="Etch, etch away!" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-11-23-switch-plates/p-9-thumb.jpg" title="Etch, etch away!" alt="Etch, etch away!" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Etch, etch away!</p><p>It took about 40-50 minutes, I think, till I was comfortable with the depth of etching. Every 10ish minutes I'd pull the piece out,
and brush it with etchant to clear the debris that, I thought, would collect in small nooks and crannies (I saw a guy do that on
one of the videos I watched).</p>
<p>After a decent etching depth was achieved, I pulled it out, and dunked it in soda to neutralize the acid.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-11-23-switch-plates/p-10.jpg" title="Neutralizing" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-11-23-switch-plates/p-10-thumb.jpg" title="Neutralizing" alt="Neutralizing" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Neutralizing</p><p>Then, lots of rinsing, while catching water into a tub. Acid, even neutralized, will contain dissolved copper, and just dumping
it is not good. I was planning to keep the tub and let water evaporate, at which point I could just wipe off the powdery residue.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-11-23-switch-plates/p-11.jpg" title="All cleaned up" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-11-23-switch-plates/p-11-thumb.jpg" title="All cleaned up" alt="All cleaned up" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">All cleaned up</p><p>After that, a rag with acetone wipes off the mask, and...</p>

   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-11-23-switch-plates/p-12-thumb.jpg" title="Etched!" alt="Etched!" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Etched!</p><p>The edges on the letters (basically, the edges of the mask) are very rough there. On these test ones, I started with a maroon
pad, but quickly went to a 120 grit non-woven deburring wheel, which cleaned it up nice (and of course, messed up the letters -
well, lesson learned, I won't use that aggressive a method on the real thing).</p>
<p>Later, when painting, I noticed that the mask was still porous, letting some acid in (I had some tiny &quot;cavities&quot; in random spots).
It looked pretty good when applied.  This would become obvious later, when I started adding color. I suspected the old drum, and decided to get a
new drum for the printer - though in hindsight, I think this is, after all, the problem of me having the Brother printer
(read on ;) ). Meanwhile, I ordered a new drum and a new cartridge.</p>
<p>And then, the paint.</p>
<p>I wanted &quot;golden&quot; letters on &quot;black&quot; background. I wanted to make the whole piece black, and then sand it on a flat surface -
everything that was masked would have the black sanded off, and the rest would keep it, achieving the effect.</p>
<p>I wanted to try a couple different &quot;make it black&quot; approaches. One would be forced oxidation with something like a gun blueing
acid, and the other would be plain paint. I had two test areas, which would allow be to try both at the same time.</p>
<p>So I blued one side....</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Sanded down</p><p>Couple notes on blueing. I tried Brownells Oxpho-Blue, and then later Birchwood Casey Brass Black. Both produce a layer of black
oxide on the brass. There are a couple of problems, though.</p>
<p>First of, the etched surface is not perfect - and those imperfections are not really hidden by oxidizing, obviously. Second,
and bigger, problem, is that that oxide is powdery, and can be rubbed off easily with even a paper towel, given enough elbow
grease. I was afraid I'd have adhesion problems with the top coat (I was gonna coat the whole thing in clear to prevent tarnishing
of letters), so I decided against it.</p>
<p>The other side I decided to put just your basic schedule of Rustoleum - primer, and flat black.</p>

   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-11-23-switch-plates/p-23-thumb.jpg" title="Rustoleum sanded down" alt="Rustoleum sanded down" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Rustoleum sanded down</p><p>I liked that side much better. However, the primer, being white, would show in between the paint and the letters, being noticeable.
I decided to find some black primer - and meanwhile, coated the whole thing in lacquer, which I decided to use as a top coat.</p>
<p>Mistake! A few weeks later, lacquer started flaking off. Yeah, I learned the &quot;no lacquer on top of  enamel&quot; rule. But it was
flaking off on plain brass too, so.. lacquer was no way to go.</p>
<p>Just typing that, in hindsight, maybe there was some acid residue after blueing... but acid was dried, and I
used acetone to clean up the blued side. But again, clear brass had lacquer coming off as well.</p>
<p>Worse part is, the enamel lifted and was coming off in pieces.</p>
<p>So instead, I did something that in hindsight I think was a mistake. I decided to look for a better paint solution,
and very quickly arrived at epoxy, specifically, <a class="reference external" href="www.klasskote.com">Klass Kote</a>. It seems to be used by a lot of RC builders
very successfully, I saw successful reports of brushing it, and talked to them, too. I was sold. Again, in hindsight... I think
this was a mistake. But, read on. :)</p>

<div class="section" id="the-actual-mask">
<h2>The Actual Mask</h2>
<p>To make the actual mask for the actual plates, I used my
<a class="reference external" href="http://79ft.net/entries/2019-08-31-alternator-pivot-arm/">scan-and-draw-around-it</a> Solidworks trick. I scanned the old placards,
and sketched around them.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Sketch</p><p>I very quickly discovered that on one of them, the sides were not parallel; and the holes were all not on one line, and not
evenly spaced! :). So, I made two versions - one all nice and even, and the other just like the old placards.</p>
<p>Using a bit of cardstock, I tried each of them on to make sure the holes are okay and such...</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Trying on the pattern</p><p>Guess which ones fit better? Yep, the crooked ones! Straightening them out made holes not line up with holes in the panel, and one
of them would interfere with some screws on the panel. Oh well.</p>
<p>Then, came quite some hours (that I didn't log to be honest) fiddling with the font and the layout. I decided to use &quot;Magneto&quot;,
the kick ass italic font out of the four I tried on my test etch.</p>

have no place in an airplane. &quot;Use standardized fonts!&quot; he said. He did have a point. If it was not me in the back hole, and
it was an emergency, readability, not style, is a prime factor. So, I had to remake them.</p>

<h2>Applying the Final Mask</h2>
<p>For material, I picked up a sheet of brushed &quot;Marine-Grade&quot; 464 .032&quot; thick brass from McMaster (remember this, &quot;brushed&quot; - one
side is brushed, the other is not).</p>
<p>On the final drawing for the mask, I replaced hole outlines with little &quot;donuts&quot; - thinking that those will make nice initial
&quot;center punch&quot; marks for the holes.</p>
<p>When printing it, the toner flaked off the transfer paper immediately. &quot;Bad sheet of paper&quot;, I thought. I also
found the &quot;Improve Toner Adhesion&quot; setting, and enabled it. That made a nice print-out.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">!??!??!?!?</p><p>What?! It worked before! A bunch of thoughts went rushing thru my head - more metal? Not getting it hot enough (but it was hot!)?
Bad toner? Wait!  YES! This time I used a completely new toner cartridge and new drum unit - to make sure my pattern has as little
of those pinholes as possible (remember, I ordered a new drum and toner after my initial test etch?)</p>
<p>I went home, and compared the serial numbers on the toner I had success with with the new toner. The first few letters were
different, as well as the few digits in the tail, which made me think it was a different brew of toner, and toner problem.
So, I printed the mask again with the toner that worked before.</p>
<p>I also
started thinking that the &quot;Improve Toner Adhesion&quot; setting I used might've caused mayhem. I <em>also</em> read a bit about that setting,
and it seems that Brother recommended using it if the toner flakes off <em>and</em> if setting the paper type properly (ie, &quot;plain&quot;,
&quot;card-stock&quot;, &quot;thick&quot;, etc) does <em>not</em> help. So to prevent flaking off, I set the paper thickness to &quot;thick&quot;, removed the
&quot;Improve Toner Adhesion&quot; setting, printed it again using the toner cartridge that worked before, and went back to the office...</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-11-23-switch-plates/p-35.jpg" title="Second attempt" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-11-23-switch-plates/p-35-thumb.jpg" title="Second attempt" alt="Second attempt" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Second attempt</p><p>This time I didn't use the &quot;pouch&quot; of paper I typically wrapped around to protect the brass and help the laminator pull it thru
(the laminator I was using had a problem with feeding first 2-3 inches of brass - it wouldn't pick it up - so I used paper as the
&quot;carrier&quot;, which alleviated the problem). I thought that maybe paper was preventing some heat from being transferred well, and
got rid of it this time.</p>
<p>Same problem!</p>
<p>What the hell?</p>
<p>I took the laminator home, determined to run a bunch of tests (it was Sunday ;) ).</p>
<p>I had a couple of old masks left (I printed double the amount then, in case first try didn't work - so that would cover
the toner/drum combo that I know have worked). I printed a couple of new ones - new drum/old toner, and new drum/new toner.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-11-23-switch-plates/p-38.jpg" title="Test pieces" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-11-23-switch-plates/p-38-thumb.jpg" title="Test pieces" alt="Test pieces" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Test pieces</p><p>I also changed the settings again, for the two new prints I made.</p>
<p>As I mentioned before, when first printing the final mask (the one that didn't transfer), I had it's toner literally flake off
the paper in some spots. &quot;Hmm, I thought&quot;, and re-printed it, using the &quot;Improve Toner Adhesion&quot; setting enabled. That made the paper go thru
the printer much slower, it came out much hotter than usual, and the toner adhered well.</p>
<p>On the second try (the one that didn't transfer either), I read a bit about the &quot;Improve Toner Adhesion&quot; setting, and decided
to instead try to change the paper type to a more appropriate one - so blaming whatever &quot;Improve Toner Adhesion&quot; did for not
transferring of toner,
and blaming &quot;thick&quot; <em>not</em> being set on the first try causing toner to flake off, I set &quot;thick&quot; for paper type - which, again,
caused the same effect - slow feed, hot paper, good adhesion.</p>
<p>And then, when finally doing a systematic attempt to figure out what's wrong, I remembered that on the very first test masks
(the ones on the test piece of brass buss bar stock), I didn't tweak any paper settings at all.</p>
<p>&quot;Slow Feed&quot;, &quot;Hot&quot;, vs &quot;Fast Feed&quot;, &quot;Colder&quot;. This time, I started guessing that maybe, higher temp did something to the toner
that would then prevent it from being re-melted when fed thru the laminator. I decided to try my luck with &quot;plain&quot; paper type
(fast, cold feed), and count on my luck in the toner adhesion department.</p>
<p>I lucked out - test pieces came out fine, and, with three test masks, thru the laminator we went again.. And again... 10 times total, as before.</p>
<p>This time, things definitely changed! First of, all three transferred equally, but they transferred equally... crappy.</p>
<p>So, we knew that we were onto something with the feed/temp settings of the printer affected by the &quot;Improve Toner Adhesion&quot; and paper
thickness settings.</p>
<p>But, transfer was still crap.</p>
<p>And then, I realized one more thing.</p>
<p>I was transferring to the &quot;brushed&quot; (remember, I had a &quot;brushed&quot; brass sheet?) side of brass? Those &quot;brush marks&quot; are noticeably
deep when you drag your fingernail across them. I suspected that, effectively, whichever pieces of the mask were above the
marks, wouldn't touch any of the metal, and therefore won't stick.</p>
<p>OKay, but I can use the other side! It was cruddy, but a bit of the deburring wheel...</p>
<p>Wait. Go to the airport to polish the other side? Ugh.</p>
<p>Found a piece of steel wool we use to scrub dishes. Phew. That, under water, made the other side of brass nice and clean on
short order.</p>
<p>OK, the moment of truth. Printed the pattern again, using the new toner/drum, now, when we know that toner/drum aren't causing
my transfer problems, but rather, the temp and the feed rate of the printer are.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Transferred!</p><p>Phew. Okay. So, I guess, after all, Brother toner <em>is</em> finicky, just like the Fab-in-a-Box guys tell you, and mine is
not special. I don't know why fast feed / low temp would even keep it transferable.. but... Well, the lesson I take from this is
that I will be carefully considering the toner type when buying a new printer, when that time comes.</p>
<p>And then, the foil. I'll admit, I did a couple attempts with the foil. Yeah, and when I didn't like what happened on the first
attempt, I had to re-do the mask (toner transfer, that is) yet again!</p>
<p>My laminator has serious feed issues. The foil is very finicky, and keeping it straight requires laminator to feed nice, smooth,
even, and straight. My laminator needs to be &quot;helped&quot; sometimes with pressure pushing the plate &quot;in&quot;.</p>
<p>Oh, well. After the second attempt, I realized that I probably won't achieve ideal results on such a big piece, and instead,
used Sharpie to fix as much holes in the foil as I could find.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Final mask, and lots of Sharpie.</p><p>So, bottom line. If I want to make perfect, non-porous etches, I need to get me a good printer that will do what I need, and
a good laminator that actually feeds things nicely. Later, later :).</p>

<h2>Paint</h2>
<p>I touched on the subject a bit already.</p>
<p>I was afraid of Rustoleum now, even learning that I messed it up myself with lacquer - it peeling off the base in sheets
didn't give me confidence. Rustoleum has clear enamel; but my reasoning was that if it peeled off <em>with</em> primer, clear enamel
without primer on relatively sharp edges of lettering will just come off almost immediately, given that my hands will always be
around the switches when operating them.</p>
<p>I settled on epoxy. It made sense. Klass Kote had good reviews from RC guys, and folks reported it brushable.</p>
<p>I completely stripped my old sample with brass wire brush and acetone. Wire brush cleaned it out nicely and smoothed
some roughness still left, so I wire brushed the new plates too. It helped, and seemingly worked better than the maroon
pad! Noted.</p>
<p>And then, I set up in the kitchen.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Set up for painting.</p><p>Klass Kote needs to be mixed, and reacted for at least 30 minutes prior to application. My plan (approved by Klass Kote) was to
do base in black, then bake it after initial flash off for 30 minutes at about 100 degrees <em>Celsius</em>. That will cure it enough to
make it sandable, after which I'd sand down the letters, and clear coat it. I won't need to bake the clear, 'cause I'm then done
for the night, and it can take it's sweet time curing.</p>
<p>Klass Kote is really thick when mixed!</p>

<p>Nope. That left the same brush marks, but just watered down, if you will. Multiple coats just made it uglier.</p>
<p>Hmm... Meanwhile, I had a batch of clear mixed too, and tried to see how the clear would look over my test plate that was now
baked and ready to be sanded down. Maybe, the brush marks would get better / a bit more hidden with extra brush marks of clear?</p>

<p>That's horrible.</p>
<p>Frustrated, I dumped my thinned batch of black into the tray I was using for garbage, and sat down thinking. My eye fell on a
foam brush I had in the set of brushes I bought. I mindlessly picked it up, and started smudging the dumped paint around the tray.</p>
<p>It flowed! Very nicely!</p>
<p>I then remembered how much I hate brushes in general. I was never able to get anything remotely approaching good with brushes.
When I built my kitchen cabs, I used cotton pads over foam brushes and achieved very smooth, mark-less results.</p>
<p>I think, this random act might've just worked!</p>
<p>I cleaned up my other, flat, coupon (the one that wasn't baked, so the epoxy would still come off with some wiping with the reducer).</p>
<p>I was now planning to mix the final batch of black I'd reduce. I'd try it on the coupon first, and then, if I liked the results,
on the actual pieces...</p>
<p>...it went on smooth, but fish-eyed a bit. I thought that that was due to some crud on the coupon (I wasn't cleaning the coupon
too good).</p>
<p>So, I put it on the actual plates.</p>
<p>It fisheyed! A lot of eyes flowed together, but some big ones stayed. I quickly dabbed them out with the corner of the brush with
some paint on it - too late, damn it! It didn't flow out. The whole thing was also rough-ish... thinned paint was flowing around
imperfections of the etched surface, as well as my dabs were messing with it, probably. There were also areas that had visible
marks of me lifting the brush.</p>
<p>At this point, I should've stopped, dunked it into the reducer, washed the whole thing off, and called it a nite.</p>
<p>But, I was too focused on getting there.</p>
<p>I thought, I might be able to get a uniform &quot;rough&quot; look.</p>
<p>Solvent was flashing off, and paint was getting thicker.</p>
<p>More paint, but this time gently, not to rub old paint off. Then, dab-dabbidy-dab the foam in and out.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">..on both</p><p>That looked acceptable, and I decided to let it  flash off the solvent. Meanwhile, went to Walmart for more foam brushes
(I only had two in the set).</p>
<p>Got back, mixed a batch of clear and left it off to react. It was looking good, with &quot;rough look&quot;, and I was thinking I might just be able to pull it off.</p>
<p>After the paint stopped being tacky, put the whole thing into my oven.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">What's for lunch, ma?</p><p>Yep, that's my toaster, repurposed as epoxy bake oven, and calibrated at 100 degrees Celsius :).</p>
<p>I forgot about solvent pop.</p>
<p>See, when you have too thick a layer of paint (which I did, when doing my &quot;rough look&quot; pass), and the top of it skins off,
some solvent might get trapped under it. What happens then is the trapped solvent  tries to evaporate, and can't: pressure builds, and it &quot;pops&quot;
the paint, making a tiny little pinhole.</p>
<p>So after 30 minutes, I pulled the plates out of the oven.  Yep, I got the pop a-plenty. Some areas of paint that were especially
thick got a ton of them.</p>
<p>I decided to stop <em>then</em>. Screw it. Rustoleum it is, as much as I hate the idea. This epoxy stuff is great (no, really, it is);
but I need to <em>spray</em> it.  So, I took a rag, wetted it with the solvent, and tried to rub the paint off.</p>
<p>Nope! It cured enough to no longer rub off with the reducer! Crap. Now, the only way to get it off is with Methylene Chloride
stripper... :(</p>
<p>Oh well. What's the best second option for a frustrated guy who failed at a paintjob at around 2 in the morning? Stop? Go to bed?
Strip and start anew?</p>
<p>Nope! I thought, &quot;well, I had a batch of clear right here. I can see if I can rub out the worst uglies with something, and try to
clear it to see if it'll hide the rest&quot;.</p>
<p>Admittedly, it did hide pretty neat.</p>
<p>I rubbed out the worst popped parts with maroon scotch brite, and sanded down the lettering.</p>

<p>What I should've done from the get go is either used Rustoleum, or got myself an airbrush. With an airbrush, it would've worked much nicer.</p>
<p>Maybe, I will strip them and re-do the paint. Maybe not - that kind of light is unusual in a cockpit. Maybe I will file this under
the &quot;don't be an idiot / don't rush a paintjob / use the right tools&quot; section, and keep them as a reminder - until I have
to make another set.</p>
<p>I don't know. We'll see.</p>

<hr class="dashed"/><p>So this one turned into a month long project, give or take. Sure, sure, I was doing other things, too: last one of which was completed
October 9th... after which I was finishing this one exclusively, pretty much.</p>
<p>Damn. One month to finish putting the brakes together. Granted, I had a hiatus for a week and a half, dealing with fixing up bad
(non-aircraft) plumbing and cutting (non-aircraft-grade) trees.</p>
<p>Regardless... Shall we?</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>After having <a class="reference external" href="http://79ft.net/entries/2019-09-30-brake-line/">finished making the new brake line</a>, I naturally wanted to install
it and call brakes done.</p>
<p>Some of the disassembly work documented here actually happened <em>prior</em> to the new line being bent up, but hey. Putting it all in one
place makes for a better narrative in <em>one</em> context.</p>
<div class="section" id="first-the-calipers">

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Ugly smudge</p><p><em>Intermission. By the way, it seems that this smudge didn't come from the dripping bleeder, but rather, judging by how the
pads were soaked, from under the brake piston. Probably the o-ring was bust, and it was weeping from between
the caliper and the piston. It seems that it had been a feature of the plane for a while.</em></p>
<p><em>Jumping a bit ahead of myself, on the other side, I discovered the brake disk somewhat dirty with oil - crankcase breather hoses
are routed into the _left_ side wheelpant and terminate near the disk - clearly, spraying a bit of oil on and around it. You'll see
those hoses on the pics of the left wheel below.</em></p>
<p><em>I think Remo's idea was to prevent oil on the belly from the breather. My friend's Ben contention was, this was a brake lock-up
prevention measure; and when he brought it up, I immediately realized... leaking piston on the _right_ caliper was a lock-up
prevention measure as well - to make sure both brakes are equally slippery - right one with brake fluid, left one with motor
oil... At any rate,..</em></p>
<p>I will admit, this was my first caliper job ever, and anchor pins presented a bit of a problem. They're press fit in the
caliper, and I didn't have an arbor press. Well, I used an old 1/4 nut that I banged on (gently!), and finished with a drift punch....</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Flushed, and drying</p><p>Do you see the other mistake I made? Yep. I mixed up the bearings (&quot;front&quot; and &quot;back&quot;). Bearings should always stay with their races...</p>
<p>Oh well. After some research, seems that the worst that will happen is wear will get accelerated.. since the bearings and races
looked squeaky clean, I decided to keep them as is.. for now. And just Hail Mary the position (since I have a 50% chance of getting
it right :)).</p>
<p>I decided to replace all the felts because I was changing grease from I didn't know what kind but likely red Mobil grease to Aeroshell 22.</p>
<p>Ironically, I apparently didn't take a single picture of the bearings being greased - probably because my hands were too greasy doing them :). Oh well.</p>
<p>The new felts came, and got coated in grease.</p>

the cotter pin... I could either get it under-tight (with perceptible play in the bearings - not good), or a bit over-tight (so that
the wheel will spin, but with some measure of resistance). Remember, I said that my mistake number one was not checking how
freely this wheel spun prior to pulling it off? Now, I was paying for it.</p>
<p>I tried flipping the bearings around (because I didn't note their original positions), thinking that maybe that will help. Nope. No change
at all.</p>
<p>Oh well.  I couldn't do anything about that at that point, so decided to settle on &quot;a bit tighter&quot; option.</p>

got tightened to super tight, loosened, and tightened to finger tight - and the wheel was perfect. No play, and no &quot;drag&quot;.</p>
<p>Le double sigh.</p>

<p>Phew. Now, finally, we can bleed and test!</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="bleeding">
<h2>Bleeding</h2>
<p>Now, there are two approaches to bleeding brakes - either bottom up (push fluid up thru the bleeder valves), or top down (sit in the
plane and squeeze the pedals while the other guy opens and closes the bleeder). Bottom up is inherently simpler.</p>
<p>Some time ago, my buddy Dick was showing off his fancy bleeder he got from ATS.</p>

   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-11-04-brakes-and-wheels/bw-47-thumb.jpg" title="DIY brake bleeder" alt="DIY brake bleeder" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">DIY brake bleeder</p><p>Pump it with air, open the valve, and the brake fluid gets pushed out thru the line that attaches to the bleeder valve on the caliper.
Child's play.</p>
<p>For bleeding, I dragged my good friend Nick S. to give me a helping hand. I could've done this by myself, but having someone watching over
the &quot;other end&quot; (it either being the end that pushes the fluid in, or the end out of which the fluid comes out) makes the job much
more pleasant.</p>
<p>Now, the way brakes are plumbed on the Charger is, each side goes from it's caliper up the gear leg to the parking brake valve, then
to the Master Cylinder, and from there both Master Cylinders are plumbed into a tee, from which the single line (the one I was re-making earlier) goes to the reservoir on the firewall.</p>
<p>We decided to bleed each side up to the tee first - to minimize the amount of air ending in the &quot;common&quot; line between the tee and the
firewall. After bleeding each side up to the tee, we'd attach the &quot;common&quot; line and bleed each side up to the reservoir, letting at least
a cup of fluid to flow thru, ensuring that we push all the air out.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">The setup</p><p>The plan went without a hitch, aside from the fact that I initially forgot to open the parking brake, and was trying to figure out why
the hell the fluid won't flow. Hehe. Nick called it, too!</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Nick holding the fluid line from reservoir</p><p>Finally, the moment of truth. The brakes were firm and nice, held well, and no leaks nowhere! Now, I need to double-check this - next
time I'm in the hangar for a good few hours, I'll set the parking brake to keep the pressure in lines, and see what happens - but
initially, everything held just fine! Phew.</p>
<p>So finally, the last bit was left.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="finishing-the-new-line-install">
<h2>Finishing the New Line Install</h2>
<p>Now, the new line was finally in place, and all that was left was to install some ADELs to hold it.</p>

you're inserting the screw and starting the nut. I don't have them.</p>
<p>Some people use safety wire.</p>
<p>I decided to try...</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Lacing cord!</p><p>It works great, too! Just double up and &quot;noose&quot; it around - it holds a clamp like a charm in the &quot;closed&quot; position while
you fiddle with the nut! Even Jack came out to see that.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Jack inspecting the work</p><p>With those clamps installed, I had to tie a bundle of wires going across the tube to the front stick's PTT switch. That one was one hell
of a contortion exercise, under the front seat's front edge and behind the stick, but I managed after a couple of tries.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Lacing the wires to brake fluid line and structure</p><p>And finally, a couple more clamps along the length of the line on the fuse to hold it in place there. Some TorqSeal, and we're done!</p>
<p>I worked out a method to these, finally, I think. I use a long (~2 inches) AN3 bolt first to &quot;thread&quot; the clamps on, and then close them
with a wrap of lacing cord using the &quot;noose&quot; method (<a class="reference external" href="http://www.aeroelectric.com/articles/cable_lace/cable_lace.html">&quot;Method 2&quot; here</a>). I then remove the long bolt, install the final bolt, and start the nut. When the nut brings clamps almost to a close, I cut off the
nooses, and tighten the nut. Works like a charm!</p>

<hr class="dashed"/><p>Prior to mounting the <a class="reference external" href="http://79ft.net/entries/2019-09-30-brake-line/">newly finished brake line</a>, I wanted to finish
fastening everything that's around it - so that I minimize wrenching around the brand new line.</p>
<p>Voltage Regulator is one of the bits that will go right there, so it was to be done.</p>
<p>I was working on it's mounting, on and off, and eventually got stuck with <a class="reference external" href="http://79ft.net/entries/2019-10-08-good-crimps/">attempting to solder a short grounding
strap</a> that was to go under one of the &quot;standoffs&quot; for the regulator.</p>
<p>And then, I was making the new brake line - but now that is done too. I also figured out how
to make that ground strap. So. nothing prevented me from completing the voltage regulator install.</p>
<p>But, we're getting ahead of ourselves.</p>
<p>First, the holes.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-10-09-vr-mounted/vr-2.jpg" title="Holes" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-10-09-vr-mounted/vr-2-thumb.jpg" title="Holes" alt="Holes" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Holes</p><p>How do you drill real good, round, quality holes, you ask?</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2019-10-09-vr-mounted/vr-3.jpg" title="Tools!" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2019-10-09-vr-mounted/vr-3-thumb.jpg" title="Tools!" alt="Tools!" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Tools!</p><p>Well. All those tools were participating in making of those holes, in sequence. Here's a game: name that sequence!</p>
<p>And then, the mounts. The regulator was to be on standoffs, to &quot;raise&quot; it above that rivet line.
The regulator wants two grounds, which will go under two of the standoffs. I also wanted to have a ground strap go under
a standoff.</p>
<p>Now, I have to explain the ground strap. I already mentioned spending quality time trying to make it.</p>
<p>I want to set up good grounding architecture in my all new electrical. This side conduit, to which the regulator is mounting, is key.</p>
<p>It's continuous, and aluminum - so it presents a really nice grounding point. I am planning to add jumpers between it and the
firewall, and it and the instrument panel, tying it all up nicely. Loads will be grounded to the conduit, firewall,
and instrument panel only.</p>
<p>Since the voltage regulator is right next to the firewall, it's very logical to have the ground strap under one of it's stands. And besides, there is already
a convenient hole right next to it for the firewall side of the grounding strap - which is why the strap is very short.</p>
<p>At any rate, those three terminals under three out of four standoffs for the regulator are making  hardware stacks of varying
thicknesses per standoff, so standoffs need to be individually sized to keep the regulator overall &quot;level&quot; above the conduit.</p>
<p>Another fly in the ointment is that &quot;jog&quot; created by one portion of the conduit riveted on top of another - that has to be
accounted for, too.</p>
<p>So four individual standoffs.</p>

Milestone!</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Ground wires</p><p>And that was it! Two more dabs of torqseal on the bottom nuts, and installed all the plugs for the holes left over from removing

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Installed!</p><p>Why not top ones as well? Well, I have this pesky gutfeeling that I will hook up an adel to at least one of them to hold
the main wiring harness to it. It's just too convenient a spot not to do it.</p>
<p>And to top it all off, did a couple of nice placards to remind myself of things :).</p>
