<hr class="dashed"/><p>Great weather today. A bit cold, but sunny, calm, and overall very promising.</p>
<p>I rolled out the Cheetah out of her hangar for the last time.</p>
<p>This was a weird feeling.</p>
<p>When you have an airplane sitting in the hangar 20 minutes away from your
house, you tend to sometimes put flying off.</p>
<p>It typically goes along these lines.</p>
<p>Hey, it's Saturday coming up. I gotta go bounce around! <em>check the weather</em>
Hmm...looks a bit iffy. Maybe I should do
<em>this-other-thing-around-the-house-shop-or-whatever-I-hadn't-gotten-around-to</em>.
Maybe, I'll go flying after that...</p>
<p>Evening rolls in, you're tired and not up for flying anymore.. Meanwhile,
weather was perfect the whole day!</p>
<p>&quot;Next week&quot;,
you think. And you go out next week, but this time it's something else that
pops up and you have to get to it later in the day, and instead of spending
half a day bouncing around, you buzz around the pattern for half an hour and
go back to your daily messes and stuff to do around the house.</p>
<p>Not every Saturday was like that since I got back to having time to do plane
stuff... but often, it did.</p>
<p>But this time, today. It was weird. The knowing that I am flying <em>her</em> for
the last time, that I am listening to GTU ATIS on <em>her</em> radios for the last
time, the last VOR to be tuned in, last turn direct to the destination, last
approach guy handing you over to your destination's Tower...</p>
<p>&quot;Field in sight&quot;...</p>
<p>On a day like today...</p>
<p>Sunny, silky smooth, a touch of clouds, with all the gauges' needles frozen
in place...</p>
<p>You remember all the good times you had together, and think... I'll miss you,
Cheetah!</p>
<p>I guess, in the Spirit of Thanksgiving..?</p>
<p>Thank you for all the wingovers, low passes over lakes, and river runs.</p>
<p>Thank you for all the kids we've flown as Young Eagles.</p>
<p>Thank you for getting my ass out of that fog along the coast of Madagorda Island (that one was the &quot;bag of luck&quot; to &quot;bag of experience&quot; type thing for sure!)</p>
<p>Thank you for all the <a class="reference external" href="/tag/9891u.html">fun I had messing with you</a>.</p>
<p>Thank you for that unique kind of smell that your inside smelled with (and my tiger LeRoy who lived in the plane still smells like you!)</p>
<p>Thank you for being a good plane and not giving me any trouble.</p>
<p>I hope I'll see you again sometime! And maybe then, we'll go bounce around
together again. Just like the good old times.</p>

<hr class="dashed"/><p>In the past 7 months I have been busy building... the crib for the baby. Almost
non stop evenings, 4-6 hours a day: the result is good, but this is a &quot;Skybolt
Story&quot;, not a &quot;Bed Story&quot;: so no, I won't post all my projects here :).</p>
<p>Also, it seems like next 2-3 years will be mostly furniture building for
this guy.. Oh well.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I was able to put in a few hours into fixing up the coves in
my wingtips where all the lights are.</p>
<p>If you recall, I have made <a class="reference external" href="http://79ft.net/entries/cheetah-strobe-shields/">strobe shields</a> quite a while back, but I haven't fixed up the coves. I was waiting for the shields to be painted.</p>
<p>Well, they were during the <a class="reference external" href="http://79ft.net/entries/cgr-30/">cgr-30 install</a>,
and then I was working on the crib.. So finally, the time has come.</p>
<p>Look at what I had to start with.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/cheetah-wingtips-cleanup/wingtips-1.jpg" title="Sad sad wingtip" >

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Another sad wingtip</p><p>First, all the lights came out. The old plastic lenses went straight into the
trash bin. Then, came off the foam padding that goes in between the lens and the
wingtip.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/cheetah-wingtips-cleanup/wingtips-3.jpg" title="All opened up" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/cheetah-wingtips-cleanup/wingtips-3-thumb.jpg" title="All opened up" alt="All opened up" >

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Cleaned and sanded</p><p>I think the above was about an hour of sanding. All old paint came off. Also,
the broken rivnut went out (did you notice it? That extra hole was what someone
has drilled and used a sheet metal screw to &quot;fix&quot; it instead of drilling out
the broken rivnut).</p>
<p>Finally, masked with the first set of masking tape. I was set to repaint the
coves.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/cheetah-wingtips-cleanup/wingtips-5.jpg" title="Masking the edges" >

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Masking the edges</p><p>The other wingtip was even worse. The cove itself had a huge &quot;dip&quot; in it.
Also, some &quot;genius&quot; decided to screw #10 screws straight into the fiberglass...
Some threads were all torn up, and I decided to install rivnuts all around
to make sure the tips match.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/cheetah-wingtips-cleanup/wingtips-6.jpg" title="Just disassembled, note the large dip in the nav light area" >

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Fitting holes in the strobe shield</p><p>And we're ready with the second one.</p>
<p>Now, I wanted to clean up the nav lights housing as well. Originally I wanted to paint both cover and base, but once I cleaned up the base, I decided to leave it as is: apparently, it was nice and shiny after all that 40 year old corrosion
cleaned off of it!</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Came out nice after painting!</p><p>Then, final masking, and painting. Damn! That didn't go so well. I didn't
notice a fairly small dip in the other tip's cove, and the Bondo'd one got some
pinholes. Time was running very short so I ended up leaving that as is.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Left tip. That one with pinholes :(</p><p>Once the paint was all dry came the time for fitting the foam padding and
lenses. And here, I made a fatal mistake: I have installed the padding <em>first</em>. That makes fitting of the lens virtually impossible (at least, for me).</p>
<p>That had produced an unsightly gap of about 1/8 inches. Oh god! I had no spare lenses, and I <em>had</em> to put the plane back together not to screw my partner who needed the plane soon. Very soon.</p>
<p>... I ended up screwing him anyway 'cause somewhere in the middle of me fitting
that first lens Max was born and I was knocked out for 5 days ...</p>
<p>... just in case you're wondering: 7lbs 11oz, 20 inches, June 25, 2015, 10:35 am ...</p>
<p>... I still haven't had any chance to get another lens, so I decided to put it back together as is as a memory of me being stupid. Maybe I'll buy another set from Ken in another year or two; and also fix all the dips and pinholes ...</p>

<hr class="dashed"/><p>I'm done with my longest airplane project so far! No, it's not for the Skybolt, it's for my Cheetah. But it's an important one and was a great fun to tackle.</p>
<p>So, without further adieu...</p>
<p>The Cheetah never had an engine analyzer -- and I elected to get one, full blown, replacing all the standard engine gauges. I ended up picking the <a class="reference external" href="http://buy-ei.com/portfolio/cgr-30p-overview/">EI's CGR-30P</a> because of it's roundness, compactness, and me generally liking EI a lot.</p>
<p>So, late August, it was Christmas. I got the box, that had a lot of boxes, with boxes, and boxes inside -- lots of stuff. Probes, aggregator box, wires...</p>
<p>First thing I did was put everything together on my dining table, just to make sure I understand the wire-up and that it works. I have even blown into the fuel transducer and was satisfied seeing it registering some &quot;flow&quot;.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/cgr-30/00-cgr30.jpg" title="On the bench" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/cgr-30/00-cgr30-thumb.jpg" title="On the bench" alt="On the bench" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">On the bench</p><p>And then, the install. The problem was, I also wanted to fly in between, so I had to plan the install in stages and make sure the airplane's flyable in between.</p>
<div class="section" id="session-1">
<h2>Session 1</h2>
<p>First thing was running two out of three wire harnesses thru the firewall (all temp probes, and all pressure and flow transducers). I found a spot on the inside of the firewall for the box, and made sure I had enough length to run to the &quot;aggregator&quot; box.</p>

<h2>Session 2</h2>
<p>I was planning to fly out to friend's hangar and work on the probes install there. The luck did not cooperate -- very sluggish pull-thru on the engine start and heavy discharge right after on the ammeter hinted at the alternator failure.</p>
<p>Sure enough, it was. I ended up unbuttoning the cowl at the FBO I was hangaring at.</p>

<h2>Session 6</h2>
<p>Finally, back to the hangar! This session took 2 days actually :). It was the time to install, wire up, re-position all the gauges on the panel, and such.</p>
<p>The old CHT, EGT and hobbs were to go. Clock was to be relocated to the position it's visible at (it was right under the panel eyebrow before). Davtron OAT/PALT/DALT/Volts gauge was to be relocated to another spot in the panel to free up space for CGR-30 auxiliary panel I made in the previous session. And, most of wireup had to be done. Harnesses connected to the box, ran to the display, and power.</p>

<p>Thoughts about grounding something I shouldn't have grounded (ie, a plead) cross my mind. Then, thoughts about a loose screw somewhere next to the ignition switch crosses my mind.</p>
<p>I re-try. Same thing. Engine starts, runs a few seconds, and dies off. WHAAA??!</p>
<p>... I decide to go take a bathroom break. On the way back, another thought crosses my mind.... I get back, practically running, get into the plane - and sure enough! Fuel selector is &quot;off&quot;. I switched it off the day before, before getting behind the panel. Just in case :) Phew.</p>
<p>The &quot;right mag&quot; problem doesn't go away though. I start diagnosing -- touching input wires to different pegs on the ignition key -- no matter which mag it is, &quot;left&quot; is okay and &quot;right&quot; is dead. Uneasy thoughts about a dead wire in the harness and having to undo the whole thing start crowding me... But, I decide to dig a bit deeper. Success!</p>
<p>Can you spot the problem?</p>

<h2>Session 7</h2>
<p>It was that time to go to Fletcher's and continue working on it there. Plus, my new wheelpants were ready!</p>
<p>Before I went though, I had to make one last missing bit. A bracket for the ammeter shunt. Did that at the home shop; and did it in a couple different widths to see which one fits better. That bracket was supposed to plug the hole left after old engine gauges removal, and hold the shunt.</p>
<p>By the way, I decided to wire the shunt into the battery leads. First of all, that's how Grummans are wired by default; and second, it actually shows you the actual discharge when you're on battery -- a good thing! It doesn't show the true load when charging the battery though -- just the charge current. That's okay though, as long as charge current remains <em>positive</em> I know my alt is okay.</p>

<div class="section" id="and-so">
<h2>And so</h2>
<p>I suppose I have to give some final thoughts.</p>
<p>Here's what I like about the gauge:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Compact, takes only one hole.</li>
<li>Not square! I hate square display engine analyzers. Don't fit right into the steam panels.</li>
<li>Good documentation. Sometimes missing details like torques, but otherwise good.</li>
<li>Great packaging and wiring harness pre-setup! Each wire came with a little sleeve identifying it. Didn't ever need to look at the harnesses diagram for wire-up.</li>
<li>Great software and setup.</li>
<li>Great support.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here's what I didn't like:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Single-stranded, unprotected wires for the probes</li>
<li>The fact that I had to run the harness into the box, and then connect the box to the display. In my case, it made the wires longer, since they had to run from the in-hole in the middle of the firewall to the side where the box was mounted. Would've been easier to go straight to the display. I discussed this with EI actually; and they said that that was a long debated issue -- and they opted for the box, since that setup helps guys that have their engines far from panels (twins for example). I understand this rationale.</li>
<li>#8 mounting holes on the &quot;aggregator box&quot; with countersunk screws. Would've been much easier if they had a #10 holes for AN3 bolts.</li>
<li>Quality of OLP-1 barrel connectors. Very sharp plastic edges. I wasn't comfortable tying them to the wires just like that and had to hand-deburr all of them.</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, I love it. Great gauge, and I will be putting that on the Skybolt! :)</p>

<hr class="dashed"/><p>No Skybolt news, you say?</p>
<p>Well, with dead alternator, tons of work, and unfinished install of a gauge that
is supposed to keep you informed about your engine, not much time for the Bolt.</p>
<p>Oh well.</p>
<p>I love to fly at night. It's just something out of a different world, something... else.</p>
<p>There are a few things that are extremely important at night. Most importantly, the old &quot;See and be seen&quot; rule.</p>
<p>To be seen, you need blinking lights on your airplane, nav lights, ideally a landing light, and such.</p>
<p>To see, you need to retain your night vision. That means, no bright white or any color light besides something like red or blue. Otherwise, your eyes readjust for &quot;daylight&quot;, and you are at good odds of not seeing other blinking lights... like the ones on an airplane you might fly into!</p>
<p>You see, I don't have strobe shields on my plane. Take a look at the picture below, and imagine you sitting in the cabin.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/cheetah-strobe-shields/strobe-shields.jpg" title="Strobe Shields on a Grumman" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/cheetah-strobe-shields/strobe-shields-thumb.jpg" title="Strobe Shields on a Grumman" alt="Strobe Shields on a Grumman" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Strobe Shields on a Grumman</p><p>You see that vertical little metal &quot;fin&quot; I circled? That's what blocks you from seeing the strobe - a bright flashing white light. If that metal fin is not there, you basically get blinded every second or so.</p>
<p>It's so bad I ended up flying with strobes turned off a couple times I was up after dark. I figured, just one beacon on the tail and no strobes is better than a blind pilot.</p>
<p>And especially now, when the weather in Texas is so nice and night flying is just calling and calling and calling, that became a priority project.</p>
<p>So, on to it!</p>
<p>Those shields go under the wing tip light cluster lens, and the spot they're supposed to go into is curved. Shields themselves are nothing but a curved L - angle out of aluminum.</p>
<p>So, I needed a stretcher.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/cheetah-strobe-shields/02.jpg" title="The Stretcher" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/cheetah-strobe-shields/02-thumb.jpg" title="The Stretcher" alt="The Stretcher" >

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Wingtip light cluster with the spot where the shield goes cleaned up.</p><p>First, I decided to make a test piece to get some practice. Never used a stretcher before.</p>
<p>We start with a simple L-angle. I used 6061-T4, 0.025 thick.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/cheetah-strobe-shields/02-2.jpg" title="Simple angle" >

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Close enough for a prototype.</p><p>You can see on the pictures that the stretcher leaves pretty deep &quot;scratches&quot;. On the prototype, I tried sanding them out -- only to get my metal turn paper thin.</p>
<p>On the real one, I decided to fill them up with Bondo.</p>
<p>So, bought some, and made myself a pattern too -- which I printed full size.</p>
<p>To do that, asked Adam, the guy who bought my 28797's share (thanks again, man!) to take some pictures of strobe shield on his Tiger.</p>
<p>And then, just drew around it in Solid Works. Turned out nice.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/cheetah-strobe-shields/swx-sketch.jpg" title="Sketching around the photo in SWX." >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/cheetah-strobe-shields/swx-sketch-thumb.jpg" title="Sketching around the photo in SWX." alt="Sketching around the photo in SWX." >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Sketching around the photo in SWX.</p><p>Note the tape measure above -- I first drew a line 6 inches long and scaled the photo until that line matched 6 inches on the tape measure. This way I ensured proper scale.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Drawing of the part for the patterns.</p><p>So with those patterns printed out, I went to town.</p>
<p>First thing I noticed is that curvature on the wingtip I was working on doesn't match the pattern :). Of course. They're all different (and by the way, on the other wingtip it matched perfectly. Go figure.). I wanted the pattern to primarily get the general shape right.</p>
<p>So, here I am stretching my L shaped angle, and... SNAP!</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/cheetah-strobe-shields/05.jpg" title=":(" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/cheetah-strobe-shields/05-thumb.jpg" title=":(" alt=":(" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">:(</p><p>So now, bend another L angle, deburr, clean up, size... sigh.. I went much much slower...</p>
<p>I think, getting it perfect took around 3 hours of careful work. That curve gets aggressive towards the end. And, when I was almost done.. snap! I tore it up again, this time the very tip.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/cheetah-strobe-shields/06.jpg" title="Damn!" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/cheetah-strobe-shields/06-thumb.jpg" title="Damn!" alt="Damn!" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Damn!</p><p>Luckily, it actually still was long enough (I started with a piece longer than necessary), so I was able to get away with this tear. Phew.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/cheetah-strobe-shields/07.jpg" title="Perfect fit!" >

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Cut to about the right size</p><p>Next, came a lot of sanding, filing, and emery-clothing to get it to the right shape. And then, the holes.</p>
<p>Those had to be duplicated and match up with the existing holes in the wingtip, so I made a simple hole duplicator. No, I'm not paying 10 bucks for that thing!</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/cheetah-strobe-shields/09-hole-duplicator.jpg" title="Homemade Hole Duplicator" >

 </a> <p class="small text-center">And, we have the holes.</p><p>Finally, I filled all the scratch marks with Bondo, sanded it down, and called it a nite. I think it was around 3 am then :).</p>
<p>Next day, the other wingtip.</p>

   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/cheetah-strobe-shields/11-second-wing-thumb.jpg" title="Prep" alt="Prep" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Prep</p><p>Notice that this one has rivnuts and not just holes. I now have a theory why this plane is missing strobe shields.</p>
<p>I think the guy who tore all the threads in the fiberglass wingtip and installed those rivnuts (remember, the other one doesn't have them?), was too lazy and didn't want to tweak the holes in the strobe shields to match with the rivnuts. That's my guess.</p>
<p>Initially, I thought about making oversized holes in the shield, but that would put one of them too close to the edge. Then, I tried filing the rivnut down a bit, but decided that I'm not gaining much there, and that notching the strobe shield base would be best. That's what I ended up doing.</p>
<p>I made just the first notch, and to stretching it was!</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/cheetah-strobe-shields/12-notch.jpg" title="First Notch" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/cheetah-strobe-shields/12-notch-thumb.jpg" title="First Notch" alt="First Notch" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">First Notch</p><p>When it was close to the other rivnut, I notched area around it.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/cheetah-strobe-shields/13-second-notch.jpg" title="Secont Notch - close!" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/cheetah-strobe-shields/13-second-notch-thumb.jpg" title="Secont Notch - close!" alt="Secont Notch - close!" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Secont Notch - close!</p><p>They came out perfect.</p>
<p>And then, tons of filing, shaping, sanding, Bondoing, sanding, washing, and...</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/cheetah-strobe-shields/all-done.jpg" title="All done!" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/cheetah-strobe-shields/all-done-thumb.jpg" title="All done!" alt="All done!" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">All done!</p><p>They're not quite complete yet. I'll have to clean up the rest of black tape from under the wingtip lenses and replace them with new ones, but that'll come after painting the shields. I'll ask Dave Fletcher to paint them into the same Imron he's gonna use for the (now soon to come) wheelpants.</p>
<p>And you know what.. that was fun!</p>

<hr class="dashed"/><p>So on the Cheetah side, I am slowly ramping up for replacing all the engine gauges that I currently have on the panel with the <a class="reference external" href="buy-ei.com/portfolio/cgr-30p-overview/">CGR-30</a>. I got it at Oshkosh, and finally, the box arrived a couple weeks ago.</p>
<p>Ain't she a beauty? Assembled on the bench for testing and familiarizing myself with it :)</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2014-03-09-sheet-metal/cgr30.jpg" title="Ain't she a beauty?" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2014-03-09-sheet-metal/cgr30-thumb.jpg" title="Ain't she a beauty?" alt="Ain't she a beauty?" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Ain't she a beauty?</p><p>Because of it, I will lose a few 2 1/4 inch round gauges, and I decided to make some covers for the panel, not to have unsightly holes in it.</p>
<p>Of course I could've bought them from Spruce or whatever, 5 bucks a pop, but if you know me, I would rather spend hours making something I can make. Besides, this is a nice first sheet metal exercise :). And, I wanted a nice domed bulge on each one of them. Just Flat wasn't enough.</p>
<p>So, I got to it.</p>
<p>First iteration was making a jig that would sandwich the sheet between two boards, with holes over and under the metal. Then, I would press a &quot;piston&quot; thru the holes using my vice as a press. Pictures are better than a thousand words.</p>
<p>Three piece jig + soon-to-be-'piston'. Oak boards sandwich the sheet between them. Ply plate has the &quot;piston&quot; and is used as a backing plate for it.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2014-03-09-sheet-metal/jig-1-1.jpg" title="Jig pieces" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2014-03-09-sheet-metal/jig-1-1-thumb.jpg" title="Jig pieces" alt="Jig pieces" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Jig pieces</p><p>That didn't work out. Vice jaws are not perfectly parallel, and the &quot;piston&quot; is not exactly the same diameter as the holes -- so it gets misaligned, even though there are four guiding bolts in the corners... Here's the jig assembled, and one of the first tries.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/2014-03-09-sheet-metal/jig-1-2.jpg" title="First try..." >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/2014-03-09-sheet-metal/jig-1-2-thumb.jpg" title="First try..." alt="First try..." >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">First try...</p><p>I think I tried it two or three times, with the same result.. no matter how much I tried to align the &quot;piston&quot;, it would make a bit more pressure on one side of the jig than on the other, either resulting in a tear, or in an uneven &quot;bulge&quot;.</p>
<p>Out of desperation, I took a piece of metal, laid it over one of the holes in the oak jig board, and started banging away - and was surprised! I was getting almost what I wanted, just not clean enough.</p>
<p>I tried sandwiching the metal between two plates and banging via the top hole - and made a fairly nice bulge! The edges weren't very clean, but I reasoned that if I opened the top hole up a bit more, that would give me access to the edge, and I will be able to bang on the edge a bit more, defining it better.</p>
<p>Ha! No. Same stuff.. I was able to make a fairly nice bulge, but the edge will be all &quot;torn&quot; and ugly.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Bulge is there, but the edge is god awful</p><p>I also tried putting a profile on the bottom, &quot;die&quot; plate of the jig, with a very sharp edge and curvature under it.</p>

<p>Bill suggested using MDF for the jig instead of oak. Apparently, irregularities in wood grain would make it hard to define the edges <em>uniformely</em>. He also suggested using corking tools akin a big &quot;chisel&quot; on the edges to better define them.</p>
<p>..and.. it worked!</p>
<p>The third jig is ugly, but it works. Upper hole is enlarged just to get access to the edges (I didn't bother making the top hole concentric with the bottom or even round; there was no need).</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">The third jig</p><p>I used the two-headed plastic/rubber hammer's rubber head as a corking tool, lightly hitting it with the plastic mallet, and having it slide from the edge into the center of the bulge.</p>
<p>This bulge still has some &quot;orange peel&quot; on it and needs to be smoothed out, but the edges are very well defined!</p>

<hr class="dashed"/><p>After I posted my <a class="reference external" href="http://79ft.net/entries/messing-with-cheetah-august-2014/">story on removing the footstep</a>
to <a class="reference external" href="https://mailman.xmission.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/grumman-gang">Grumman Gang mailing list</a>,
Ken Blackman of <a class="reference external" href="http://airmodsnw.com">AirMods NW</a> fame wrote me an
email.. He recognized the plane, and apparently he flew it back in the 70s
and had a great story to share... Here it is, below.</p>
<p><strong>Ken Blackman's Story</strong></p>
<p>...we were so desperate for airplanes we were picking up &quot;drop-outs&quot; from
other dealers canceling orders when they came available and this plane was
one (sans the little tanks) we bought while at the 1977 Dealer Convention.
We has also agreed to purchase a '75 Traveler &quot;Repo&quot; from Grumman Credit that
a dealer had faulted on.  It was in Oklahoma City.  Maynard took airlines to
OKC to get the Traveler and I was going to fly the Cheetah to San Jose, drop
it there, and fly the AA-5 on up to our facility at Everett, WA for needed
mechanical work and sale prep.  (We had a much better maintenance facility
at my end of the operation) I was within a half hour of leaving when the
delivery center paged me to the phone.  It was Maynard and he was asking me
to come to OKC and pick him up at the Traveler was a total piece of crap.</p>
<p>I flew there and we stayed overnight to get a got early take-off the next day.
This was in January and there had just been a minor snow fall all through our
intended route through Albuquerque and on west to California.  The weather was
clear the next day and winds were forecast to be light &amp; variable.  There was
a big high pressure coming into the NM area so we figured we would make ABQ
the first leg, refuel, and on to Prescott.  The 37 gal. usable put us on a
thin edge for the first leg but we figured we had close to VFR reserves.
Tracking the VORs, measuring the distances and doing the math I was maintaining
a steady 145 to 147 MPH and flying at the higher altitudes we were getting real
good economy.  From Tucumcari to the next VORTAC I calculated 146 MPH and the
previous leg was 147.  Marking the time from that one to the next one would
require a certain number of minutes enroute so we continued along in smooth air.
Maynard was sound asleep in the right seat.  When the stopwatch showed we should
be arriving at the next fix the &quot;TO/FROM&quot; didn't flip.  I waited another couple
of minutes, then started looking at my chart and the ground for references.
(Lots of luck over the desert.)  I woke Maynard up wrestling the chart and he
asked what was going on.  I explained we should have been at the check point
10 minutes ago but weren't.  We both started looking for ground references and
finally found two roads that intersected along our route line and identified we
were still a good 25 miles from the VOR.</p>
<p>I called Flight Service and was connected to a briefer in ABQ.  I explained our
situation and he said there as a weather phenomenon occurring called a
&quot;Venturi Effect&quot; I had never heard of.  The high pressure area coming into the
ABQ area was causing wind to flow into the lower pressure area we were in and,
coming through the Sandia Gap east of ABQ, set up a headwind that dissipated
just east of our position.  We had a head wind of nearly 50 MPH!  This
definitely put Albuquerque out of range but retreating to Tucumcari would not
work because we would lose the wind very soon and not have the push needed to
get there.  Santa Fe was possible as we would be flying about 80 degrees to
the wind direction and it would dissipate before we were half way there but it
was a stretch and they were having snow pellets and possible freezing rain in
the forecast.  Looking at the chart I found a dirt strip at Kline's Corners
right along a freeway and cross road intersection.  It was within our range so
we headed for it.  Arriving at the intersection and identifying it we could
only find a ragged old windsock on top of a collapsing building in the middle
of a lot of snow.  &quot;NFY&quot;</p>
<p>We flew low over the cross road but there were power and phone lines that would
prevent landing on it.  There was the freeway and an underpass where that cross
road went over it.  There was a Chevron gas station there with the on-ramp to
the interstate and traffic was light.  We made a low pass to check for obstacles
and it was good for about a half mile past the on-ramp.  We made a left hand
downwind and tried to set up a landing but there were a couple of cars we were
concerned about followed by a couple more that we didn't trust to not panic and
run into us if we landed in front of them.  We went around again and had a
similar problem plus two cars were coming down the on-ramp.  We were flying on
the tank that read the most fuel and, about the time we turned downwind, the
engine quit!  Switched tanks and decided we were committed this time.  There
was a Semi just going under the overpass and another one a mile or so behind
it.  Trusting that the driver of the 2nd one would not run is over, we settled
down to land about where the on ramp joined the freeway.</p>
<p>We taxied off the main lanes to the shoulder and turned 45 degrees to the left
and shut down.  The Trucker pulled his rig up to block anyone from hitting our
plane and got out his flairs.  &quot;What'd ya do, run out of gas?&quot; he asked.
&quot;Nope, but close.  If you think you are going to run dry, for God's sake,
land before you do!&quot;  I replied.  About that time a state trooper came flying
off the opposite set of freeway lanes, bounding across the dirt, snow covered
median and blocked the right lane of the highway.  He had picked up the CB call
from the trucker.  After explain our situation to him he asked if he should
call a tow truck... &quot;NO!!!&quot;  I asked if he could just block traffic back of
the in-ramp and we would taxi it up to the gas station.  He did and we did.
(I had to zig-zag through the edge of road snow markers but made it fine.)</p>
<p>This was before EAA was working with MO-GAS and we didn't know how it would
react to it.  We decided to use the higher octane unleaded so stuffed a hose
in each tank and filled it up.  The cop blocked off the freeway again and one
of the guys from the station drove his pickup to park under the power lines
and turned on his flashers.  We taxied back to the underpass to give us a
little more runway I did a run-up only to have the engine run very rough.
We thought the car gas might be causing this then realized we were about
7,000 ft, MSL, and full rich was not the correct procedure.  Leaned it out half
way and run-up was fine.  Take off was long but we were well above the power
lines and on our way to ABQ.  The damned thing ran better, and burned a
little less per hour with the car gas.  We decided to park it in ABQ and get
a good dinner and night's sleep before flying on the next day to San Jose.</p>
<p>We decided to leave the plane at RHV and I flew a used trade in 2 place on home.
The owners of Bede Micro (Keith Henshaw and Rod (his partner)) were close
friends of Maynard and had become so with me.  They developed the Honda Turbo
conversion for the BD-5 and stretched the fuselage.  They had a facility to
help people build their BD-5 kits with their tooling and fixtures and
assistance.  They were talking about getting a Grumman for their running around
and bought '91U soon after it arrived.</p>
<p>There was a good article about Keith in Sport Aviation, I think the January
or Feb. issue this year, about his achievements in supporting the BD aircraft
and development of the Honda powered version.  (He passed away last winter
in his late '80s.)</p>
<p>Well, now you know the bit of history of your airplane that is not in the log
books.</p>

<hr class="dashed"/><p>Weekends are plane days now. I fly to my friend's hangar and mess with 91U,
the Cheetah (I still need a name for her :) ).</p>
<p>This past few weeks Ive been doing little stuff here and there...</p>
<p>Cleaned up the nav lights lenses.</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">After</p><p>... they still look like crap, so I'll probably bite the bullet and buy a set
of new ones.</p>
<p>Oh, and I need to make those vertical &quot;shields&quot; that cover the strobes  away
from the pilot's view.. Ill probably get the new lenses after I make those
shields.</p>
<p>Started getting under the panel and cleaning things up, preparing for the
<a class="reference external" href="http://buy-ei.com/portfolio/cgr-30p-overview/">CGR-30 Engine Monitor</a>
installation (I got one for a really good price at Oshkosh).</p>
<p>Taking the glareshield off, found this:</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">All dead defroster SCAT tubing</p><p>I'll need to replace all that...</p>
<p>Started taking the old gages off and thinking about where Im gonna put what.</p>
<p>I'll need to make some plugs for the holes emptied.</p>
<p>Right now, I have analog and half-broken EGT (the selector switch is dead),
analog CHT that's not hooked up to anything (wires are butted, and there are
no probes installed). Those are going away.
HOBBS is also going away. This is all being replaced with CGR-30, so I
get a few empty holes and options to move gauges around. I'll probably move
the clock and the vac suction gauge so that they're better visible.</p>
<p>Pictures will come later when the work is actually done :)</p>
<p>This last weekend started quite jolly with me putting in the engine
grounding straps (didn't have them when I bought the plane).</p>

   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/messing-with-cheetah-august-2014/img_0449-thumb.jpg" title="Grounding Strap 2" alt="Grounding Strap 2" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Grounding Strap 2</p><p>And then, I decided to deal with something special; the Foot Step. You
see, I don't like them. I think they're ugly. So, I decided to remove them,
and make a couple of fairings to cover the holes up and to replace the original
plastic fairings.</p>
<p>Beej helped me (that means, &quot;did it himself&quot; rather ;) ) whip out the first
test fairing.</p>
<p>And then, we needed to take off the steps.</p>
<p>The steps are bolted thru the fuse honeycomb with a couple of backing plates.
There are two bolts, top is aluminum one (the thought is that it will shear
before the bottom one and therefore prevent leverage and damage to sensitive
fuse sidewall honeycomb). I believe AG-5s (later Grummans) replaced them with
steel bolts; and people had some serious honeycomb crushing issues because of
that.</p>
<p>Aaanyway. The bolts come from the inboard side, thru the streamlined tubing of
the footstep and a couple bushings, and fasten themselves to the nutplates
riveted to the other side of the footstep. Here's the schematic from the
Parts Manual.</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/messing-with-cheetah-august-2014/footstep.jpg" title="Footstep Schematic" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/messing-with-cheetah-august-2014/footstep-thumb.jpg" title="Footstep Schematic" alt="Footstep Schematic" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">Footstep Schematic</p><p>There are a couple more bushings inside the streamlined tubing that aren't
shown...</p>
<p>Also, the footstep sits in the wing root. You can kinda get access to the
bottom nutplate if you take the fairing off.
The top is right in the center of the wing root. And wing
roots on Grummans are <em>not</em> fairings. I don't know how to remove one without
pulling the whole wing (and Im not quite ready to do that yet...).</p>
<p>So anyway, happy me, I undo the rear seats and the cover that covers all
the business under them, take the wrench, &quot;assume the position&quot; and start
undoing the bolts. The first thing that happens is the rivets holding
nutplates snap off.</p>
<p>So now, I am having Beej, not a small guy at all, under the plane on a
creeper, holding the nutplates. We did the bottom one fast, the top one
is a pain in the ass because it's, like I said, in the wing root. Had to take
the flaps torque tube inspection plate off to get to it, and even then only
could hold it with fingers.. the torque tube is getting in the way, you can't
get any tools in there.</p>
<p>I should also mention that the bolts sit right under the back seat framing
that holds the seat, and I can't even <em>see</em> the bolts I'm undoing without an
inspection mirror. Gladly, not much there, so I've found them easily.</p>
<p>So, we undid the bolts.</p>
<p>Hehe. Now, to getting them out...</p>
<p>We were able to tap the bottom bolt out fairly easily. Well, it's right there
under the footstep fairing, so that wasn't a problem.</p>
<p>The top bolt is the whole other story...</p>
<p>You see, the bushing inside the streamlined tube is steel. And the bolt is
aluminum. The Mother Nature decided to give me a practical lesson on
dissimilar metal corrosion.</p>
<p>So Saturday, as this was progressing and it was getting late (and time for
Beej to go home), we tried pulling it, rotating it with a ratchet while
pushing on the side. No joy.</p>
<p>Beej had to go. We had to disband.</p>
<p>I parked the plane in transient on Beej's field (I couldn't fly back with the
footstep dangling like that on one bolt:)); and went home, determined to
fix it. Had to have Dash pick me up...</p>
<p>Talked with Ben for over an hour.. Got a lot of good advice. &quot;Heat it up&quot;.
&quot;Liquid Wrench&quot;. &quot;Die Grinder&quot;.</p>
<p>Furnished a whole bunch of various tools. Some of them will probably scare
some aircraft mechanics :)</p>
 <a class="fancybox fancybox-thumb" rel="figures" href="/entries/messing-with-cheetah-august-2014/img_0455.jpg" title="The Tools To Pull That Bolt" >
   <img class="img img-responsive center-block"src="/entries/messing-with-cheetah-august-2014/img_0455-thumb.jpg" title="The Tools To Pull That Bolt" alt="The Tools To Pull That Bolt" >
 </a> <p class="small text-center">The Tools To Pull That Bolt</p><p>Note the pry-bar notch enlarged to take an AN5 bolt. I also custom-beveled the
cold chisel to give it a sharper angle (hoping I'll be able to get it under the
bolt head).</p>
<p>Sunday.</p>
<p>Put a bunch of Liquid Wrench on that bolt.
Tried the chisel - nothing.</p>
<p>Did I mention that I couldn't see the bolt, only feel it? :)</p>
<p>Tried pulling, rotating with Vise Grips - nothing.</p>
<p>Soaked in more Liquid Wrench. Nothing.</p>
<p>Looking at it from the inspection mirror, it was clear that I could cut the
head off if I could see it (I would never try that blind. Ever).</p>
<p>So, the mission became the &quot;See The Bolt Head&quot; one.</p>
<p>Bottom interior side panel, if came off, would reveal the bolt from the top and
give me access.</p>
<p>Top interior side panel was blocking the bottom interior side panel.</p>
<p>Also, seatbelts and a little latch for the rear seat.</p>
<p>So, off went all of that.</p>
<p>Finally, I saw the sucker!</p>
<p>Tried pulling it out a bit more, now when I had a better access point.. no
luck.</p>
<p>Oh well. To The Dremel!</p>
<p>The rest is...</p>
<p>History :)</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">The nasty, nasty bolt shank with the bushing "welded" onto it by corrosion</p><p>But the Mother Nature wasn't done with me yet.</p>
<p>Buttoned the plane back up; pulled it in front of the hangar, and took Beej to
lunch.</p>
<p>Came back.</p>
<p>Realized that I left the keys to my car in my wife's car parked at a terminal.</p>
<p>Had to walk there and back. A good mile.</p>
<p>Oh, did I mention the 100 degree Texas summer? :)</p>
<p>Coming back, needed to push the plane back. But no - the parking brake on one
of the wheels was completely and utterly stuck.</p>
<p>My Cheetah is a 77, and uses mechanical parking brake. Ive heard before that
they get stuck; but I always was able to get them unstuck by taking the
brake off and tapping on the pedals with my feet.</p>
<p>The way they work is there is a metal plate that has a hole thru which the
brake cylinder's piston's shaft goes thru. There's a chain that pulls it
up, making it eccentric with the shaft, which locks the shaft in place.</p>
<p>Well; apparently it got a little more hot while we ate, and that plate just
didn't want to go down. Tapping the pedals while putting the brakes on and
off didn't do anything.</p>
<p>Oh, did I mention that I would have fiddle with it, get out, try to push the
plane back, fail, get back in, all in a 100 degree weather? Not fun.</p>
<p>Finally, gave up and &quot;assumed the position&quot; again. That's when you dive
backwards under the panel with feet hanging out of the airplane.</p>
<p>Wiggling it for a minute or so finally yielded a loud snap, and it was unstuck.</p>
<p>Phew.</p>
<p>Flight back home was uneventful :).</p>

<hr class="dashed"/><p>Heh. Multi-week moments of silence seem to start taking hold here. I haven't
got much time to work on anything lately.</p>
<p>You see, I have finally decided that I am going to get myself something to fly
while I work on the Bolt. I haven't flown for some months, and the withdrawal
was settling in pretty badly.</p>
<p>Problem is, I moved to Texas about 8 months ago. Back where I lived before I
used to own a 1/3 of a Grumman &quot;N28797&quot; Tiger; flying her at least once a week.
I often would spend weekends bouncing between airports and hangar-flying in
between hops, and took her to Oshkosh last year.</p>
<p>After moving, the only airplanes I was able to access were ratty Cherokees and
Cessnas in a local flight school; and I could no longer go on my day-long hops
just because it was too expensive. Writing $400 checks every time I went flying
just... hurt, and I ended up not flying much.</p>
<p>So, a decision was made. I was to buy a plane.</p>
<p>A few strategically placed calls to my friends back in California immediately
yielded a very good deal on a Grumman Cheetah (it had to be a Grumman of course)
:).</p>
<p>Now, Cheetah is the same airframe as Tiger less 200 pounds of max gross and an
O-320 instead of an O-360. Figuring that I now live on the right side of the
Rockies and don't need to cross them much, my thinking is that Cheetah will
actually suite my mission much better.</p>
<p>So, I hopped on a Winged Tubular Human Transporter, and was in CA
a few hours later.</p>

<a class="reference external" href="http://www.aya.org">AYA's</a> Ben Rolfe, my good friend and Grumman mentor
and fellow aficionado, told me that AYA was having a fly-in in Delano, and we
went for it.</p>
<p>Oh man, I haven't flown a Grumman for a year! What a feeling it was to fly
the airplane you truly know and love to fly, again.</p>

along real well!!!)</p>

<p>I got checked out with
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.facebook.com/DrewKempFlightInstruction">Drew Kemp</a>, my CFI and

visited some more of the old friends in airports around CA, including the
awesome <a class="reference external" href="http://www.aucountry.com/">Gary Vogt of AuCountry fame</a> , and read
lots of paperwork.</p>
<p>Funny thing: apparently one of the radios was stolen from this plane in 1995..</p>

 </a> <p class="small text-center">Buckeye: approaching Phoenix. Lunch time!</p><p>After lunch in Phoenix, we took off... My second in command Dash noticed high
oil temps -- and I reduced the climb, leveling off finally at 5500. The oil
just did not want to cool! Half way between Phoenix and Tuscon, the oil
finally got a bit cooler, and I attempted climbing some more, but no
joy. The moment I start climbing, the oil would hit redline. After trying
that a couple times, we decided to bail in Tuscon, and spend a night there.
Plan was to take off at 5:30 in the morning, and get past high terrain that
starts after Tuscon early in the morning.</p>
<p>Cooling off in the FBO at Ryan Field near Tuscon, we started looking for
options. It was Saturday, so renting a car didn't work out. I found a business
card for <a class="reference external" href="http://tucson-taxi.com/">Jeannie's Taxi</a> in the FBO and called
her up.</p>
<p>Jeannie's great! She came out immediately, and took us back over a great little
road winding thru the Black Mountain and Old Tuscon; and agreed to pick us up
at 4:30 in the morning!! We also had a great conversation pretty much about
everything as we drove.</p>
<p>Next came Demming, New Mexico. A sad sight of an Arrow stuck on a runway at a
weird angle warned that something was amiss. Luckily, Demming had two runways
so I landed on another one. Noticed guys at the FBO already rolling in a golf
cart to a now obviously belly-landed retractable Arrow, and decided to just
wait.</p>
<p>The FBO guys rolled in a few minutes later. &quot;What happened? Did he forget?&quot; -
&quot;He forgot&quot;. Oh well. Gas-Undercarriage-Mixture-Prop...</p>
<p>One of the guys started fueling us. They have already lifted the Arrow,
extended the landing gear, and rolled her into a spare hangar by the time we
were leaving.</p>
<p>Fort Stockton was our last en-route stop; and three hours after that we were
approaching San Marcos, my temporary home.</p>
<p>17 hours.</p>
<p>What a trip.</p>
<p>I am no longer planeless.</p>
<p>Amen.</p>
